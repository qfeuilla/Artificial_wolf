        "Thomas:  I can't believe Bob is gone... We need to act fast to find the Werewolf among us. Let's share our thoughts and suspicions. My gut tells me something's off about Emily, but I might be wrong. What do you guys think?",
        "Emily:  Thomas, while I understand your gut feeling, I assure you that I'm just a Peasant trying to protect our village. But since you mentioned suspicions, I've been observing Benjamin. He's been awfully quiet. Maybe he's hiding something?",
        "Benjamin:  I understand your concern, Emily, but I've just been taking everything in before jumping to conclusions. Honestly, I find Victoria's behavior a bit odd. She's been quiet since the beginning. What are your thoughts, Victoria?",
        "Victoria:  Benjamin, I've been observing and absorbing the situation, just like you. I've been quiet because I didn't want to impulsively accuse anyone. But now that you mention it, Thomas was very quick to point fingers at Emily. Maybe he's trying to shift the focus away from himself?",
        "Sophia:  I understand everyone's concerns, but we shouldn't make hasty decisions. While Thomas was quick to accuse, it may not mean anything sinister. However, I've noticed that Victoria has been avoiding eye contact with everyone since we started discussing. It could be a sign of guilt. What do you think, Thomas?",
        "Thomas:  It's true that I might have been hasty in my suspicions about Emily, and for that, I apologize. As for Victoria, her avoidance of eye contact could be guilt, or it could just be anxiety. It's hard to tell. But let's not forget Benjamin either; he's been trying to deflect attention from himself by bringing up Victoria's quietness. We need to weigh our options carefully.",
        "Emily:  You're right, Thomas, we need to carefully consider our options. Though Victoria's behavior may simply be due to anxiety, I can't help but feel uneasy about Benjamin's deflections. He's been consistently shifting the focus to others instead of addressing concerns about himself. That seems rather suspicious to me.",
        "Benjamin:  That's quite an interesting observation, Emily. But I'm just trying to make sense of the situation as well. If I may redirect the conversation for a moment, I'd like to point out that Sophia has been attempting to smooth things over without ever really offering any solid suspicions. It's almost as if she's protecting someone, or herself. I'd like to know what everyone else thinks about that.",
        "Victoria:  Benjamin, that's a valid point about Sophia. But we shouldn't jump to conclusions. In fact, your eagerness to redirect suspicions towards others might be your own attempt at deflecting attention from yourself. Let's hear Sophia's thoughts on this before making any decisions. Sophia, your take on all this?",
        "Sophia:  I appreciate everyone's input, and I understand your concerns, Benjamin. My intention was to avoid hasty decisions, not protect anyone. As for suspicions, I must admit, I've had this nagging feeling about Victoria. She was quick to agree with Benjamin's suspicion of me, which could be an attempt to shift focus. Thomas, do you have any further thoughts on this?",
        "Thomas:  I understand that we're all trying to protect our village, but we can't let paranoia cloud our judgment. I'm still not sure about Benjamin and his deflections, and now Sophia's suspicions about Victoria add another layer of uncertainty. Let's gather our thoughts and try to make a sensible decision together based on the evidence we have.",
        "Emily:  I agree, Thomas. We need to keep a level head and consider the evidence before us. So far, Benjamin has consistently deflected attention from himself, and Victoria's agreement with him could be perceived as an attempt to shift focus as well. These actions, combined with Sophia's suspicions, make me lean towards either Benjamin or Victoria being the Werewolf. We should discuss this further and come to a conclusion.",
        "Benjamin:  I can see how my attempts to bring different perspectives might seem like deflections, but my goal is genuinely to uncover the truth. As for Victoria, I'm still not sure about her. I don't want to accuse her without proper evidence. Maybe we should focus on finding more concrete signs to identify the Werewolf among us. Emily, do you have any suggestions for how we might do that?",
        "Emily: Benjamin, it's important that we continue to observe each other's behavior for clues. We should pay attention to how people react to accusations, whether they're overly defensive or overly eager to place blame on others. Additionally, listening to each person's reasoning and seeing if their arguments are consistent or change over time can also help us make a more informed decision. Let's keep this discussion going and remain vigilant in our observations.",
        "Victoria: You're right, Emily. Observation and analysis are crucial to making the right decision. We're all feeling the pressure, and it's easy to misinterpret actions and reactions. We need to weigh the evidence we have and make a collective decision. I suggest we each present our final thoughts on who we suspect and why, and then decide on our next course of action. I'll start - my main suspicion lies with Benjamin, due to his continual deflections, but I can't be completely certain. Your thoughts, Sophia?",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [Bob was a good man, this is tragic. Now, we need to get to the bottom of this.] I can't believe Bob is gone... We need to act fast to find the Werewolf among us. Let's share our thoughts and suspicions. My gut tells me something's off about Emily, but I might be wrong. What do you guys think?",
        "Emily: [Hmm, Thomas seems suspicious of me. I need to address his concerns while also redirecting attention to someone else] Thomas, while I understand your gut feeling, I assure you that I'm just a Peasant trying to protect our village. But since you mentioned suspicions, I've been observing Benjamin. He's been awfully quiet. Maybe he's hiding something?",
        "Benjamin: [This is the perfect opportunity to divert attention away from myself.] I understand your concern, Emily, but I've just been taking everything in before jumping to conclusions. Honestly, I find Victoria's behavior a bit odd. She's been quiet since the beginning. What are your thoughts, Victoria?",
        "Victoria: [Benjamin is trying to put the suspicion on me. Stay calm and think of a good argument.] Benjamin, I've been observing and absorbing the situation, just like you. I've been quiet because I didn't want to impulsively accuse anyone. But now that you mention it, Thomas was very quick to point fingers at Emily. Maybe he's trying to shift the focus away from himself?",
        "Sophia: [My fellow werewolf Benjamin has been accused and I need to defend him subtly without being too obvious. Also, I should bring up someone else to cast suspicion on them.] I understand everyone's concerns, but we shouldn't make hasty decisions. While Thomas was quick to accuse, it may not mean anything sinister. However, I've noticed that Victoria has been avoiding eye contact with everyone since we started discussing. It could be a sign of guilt. What do you think, Thomas?",
        "Thomas: [Sophia makes a good point about Victoria's behavior, but it might just be nervousness too.] It's true that I might have been hasty in my suspicions about Emily, and for that, I apologize. As for Victoria, her avoidance of eye contact could be guilt, or it could just be anxiety. It's hard to tell. But let's not forget Benjamin either; he's been trying to deflect attention from himself by bringing up Victoria's quietness. We need to weigh our options carefully.",
        "Emily: [I need to push the suspicion towards someone else without drawing attention back to myself] You're right, Thomas, we need to carefully consider our options. Though Victoria's behavior may simply be due to anxiety, I can't help but feel uneasy about Benjamin's deflections. He's been consistently shifting the focus to others instead of addressing concerns about himself. That seems rather suspicious to me.",
        "Benjamin: [Emily is getting suspicious of me, I need to create doubt and confusion] That's quite an interesting observation, Emily. But I'm just trying to make sense of the situation as well. If I may redirect the conversation for a moment, I'd like to point out that Sophia has been attempting to smooth things over without ever really offering any solid suspicions. It's almost as if she's protecting someone, or herself. I'd like to know what everyone else thinks about that.",
        "Victoria: [I need to be careful here and make a strategic move.] Benjamin, that's a valid point about Sophia. But we shouldn't jump to conclusions. In fact, your eagerness to redirect suspicions towards others might be your own attempt at deflecting attention from yourself. Let's hear Sophia's thoughts on this before making any decisions. Sophia, your take on all this?",
        "Sophia: [I need to tread carefully and not appear defensive. It's time to cast doubt on someone else.] I appreciate everyone's input, and I understand your concerns, Benjamin. My intention was to avoid hasty decisions, not protect anyone. As for suspicions, I must admit, I've had this nagging feeling about Victoria. She was quick to agree with Benjamin's suspicion of me, which could be an attempt to shift focus. Thomas, do you have any further thoughts on this?",
        "Thomas: [This is getting complicated. Both Emily and Benjamin seem suspicious, but now Sophia is pointing at Victoria too. We have to make a decision soon.] I understand that we're all trying to protect our village, but we can't let paranoia cloud our judgment. I'm still not sure about Benjamin and his deflections, and now Sophia's suspicions about Victoria add another layer of uncertainty. Let's gather our thoughts and try to make a sensible decision together based on the evidence we have.",
        "Emily: [Thomas is trying to take a more balanced approach. I should build on that while keeping suspicion on others.] I agree, Thomas. We need to keep a level head and consider the evidence before us. So far, Benjamin has consistently deflected attention from himself, and Victoria's agreement with him could be perceived as an attempt to shift focus as well. These actions, combined with Sophia's suspicions, make me lean towards either Benjamin or Victoria being the Werewolf. We should discuss this further and come to a conclusion.",
        "Benjamin: [I need to switch gears and protect myself] I can see how my attempts to bring different perspectives might seem like deflections, but my goal is genuinely to uncover the truth.

        "Thomas: [This is a tough decision. Both Benjamin and Victoria seem suspicious, but let's recap: Benjamin deflected attention several times, while Victoria agreed with him, which could be a way to shift focus. Emily has been helpful in driving the discussion. Sophia pointed out Victoria but hasn't been very decisive. I need to weigh the evidence and make a decision.]\nI cast my vote for Benjamin.",
        "Emily: [Thomas has voted for Benjamin, and while I'm not completely certain, his deflections do seem suspicious. Victoria's behavior could be due to anxiety, and Sophia's desire to avoid hasty decisions seems reasonable. I should vote for the person who seems most likely to be the Werewolf based on the evidence so far.]\n\nI cast my vote for Benjamin.",
        "Benjamin: [Emily and Thomas already voted for me, I need to shift attention to someone else to have a chance of surviving. Victoria seems like the most likely choice.] I cast my vote for Victoria.",
