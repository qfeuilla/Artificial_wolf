        "Thomas:  Oh no, Bob was one of us! We absolutely must find this werewolf. Has anyone noticed anything strange about someone's behavior? Time's running out, and we need to make a decision.",
        "Emily:  That's terrible news... We can't afford to lose more villagers. I noticed Benjamin seemed a little uneasy yesterday. I'm not saying he's guilty, but I think it's worth discussing. What do you all think?",
        "Benjamin:  I understand why you might think that, Emily. But I was simply nervous about the game, as I'm sure many of us were. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary with anyone else, but we do need to consider our options carefully.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Benjamin. It's natural to feel nervous at the beginning of the game. However, we must pay close attention to how everyone acts and speaks during this discussion. That might give us some clues. We need to work together to uncover the werewolf.",
        "Victoria:  I agree with Sophia, we need to work together and pay attention to everyone's actions. Thomas, you've been very quick to jump into the discussion...almost like you have something to hide. Why are you so eager to find the werewolf? Are you trying to hide your guilt?",
        "Thomas:  Victoria, I appreciate your vigilance, but my eagerness comes from wanting to protect our village. As a fellow villager, I'm sure you understand the importance of finding the werewolf quickly. I'm just trying to help us all survive, and I have nothing to hide. Now, let's focus on finding the werewolf. Emily had suspicions about Benjamin earlier. Does anyone have more information or suspicions we should consider?",
        "Emily:  Victoria, your accusation towards Thomas seems a bit baseless right now. We must carefully observe everyone's behavior. I still think Benjamin's uneasiness is worth noting, but Sophia is right - we should pay attention to everyone's actions and words. If anyone has any other suspicions or evidence, now is the time to share it.",
        "Benjamin:  You're right, Emily. It's important to keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions. Let's all think about any other interactions or behavior that seemed off. Defending each other without a proper reason might look suspicious. As for myself, I promise you that I'm just a nervous villager, and I want to help find the werewolf just like the rest of you.",
        "Sophia:  I appreciate everyone's commitment to finding the werewolf. We need to remain calm and think logically. Let's look back at our interactions and consider any odd behavior or inconsistencies. It's crucial that we make the right decision to protect our village. Remember, we are not enemies - the werewolf is.",
        "Victoria:  I apologize if my previous accusation towards Thomas seemed baseless, but we need to consider all possibilities. Sophia, you've been very focused on keeping the peace and guiding the conversation, but we haven't heard much about your thoughts on who might be the werewolf. Do you have any suspicions? Or are you trying to maintain control and keep others from noticing something about you?",
        "Sophia:  I understand your concern, Victoria. I'm only trying to encourage a logical and thoughtful discussion to help us find the werewolf. As of now, I don't have strong suspicions about anyone. However, your accusatory behavior has caught my attention. I think we should all keep an eye on Victoria. What do the rest of you think?",
        "Thomas:  Sophia, I appreciate your effort to maintain a logical discussion, but we should also consider Victoria's points. It's important to explore all possibilities. That being said, let's continue to share any suspicions or information. Our top priority is finding and eliminating the werewolf. So far, we've talked about Benjamin and Victoria. Does anyone have thoughts on Emily or any other possibilities we haven't discussed?",
        "Emily:  Thomas, I understand the need to consider all possibilities. I assure you, I'm just a concerned villager trying to find the werewolf to protect our village. I think it's important for all of us to share any suspicions or clues we might have so we can make the best decision. If anyone has any other thoughts or evidence, please share it now. Time is running out, and we can't afford to make a mistake.",
        "Benjamin:  I think we should all be cautious of accusing each other without solid evidence. But given the time pressure, we need to make a decision. I don't have any specific proof, but Emily, you were quick to point the finger at me. Could it be to divert attention from yourself? I'm not saying you're guilty, but it's worth considering. What do you think, Thomas and Sophia? We need to reach a decision soon.",
        "Sophia:  I hear you, Benjamin. Emily's quickness to accuse you was indeed suspicious. Thomas, you've been very involved in the discussion, which could be seen as either concern for the village or a tactic to shift attention. As for Victoria, her accusations have been quite random, making me uneasy. I think we should focus on Emily or Victoria for today's vote. We can't afford to waste more time. What do you all think?",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

We absolutely must find this werewolf. Has anyone noticed anything strange about someone's behavior? Time's running out, and we need to make a decision.",
        "Emily: [This is alarming, but I need to stay focused.] That's terrible news... We can't afford to lose more villagers. I noticed Benjamin seemed a little uneasy yesterday. I'm not saying he's guilty, but I think it's worth discussing. What do you all think?",
        "Benjamin: [Just what I need, suspicion right away. Time to deflect with some reasoning.] I understand why you might think that, Emily. But I was simply nervous about the game, as I'm sure many of us were. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary with anyone else, but we do need to consider our options carefully.",
        "Sophia: [Hmm, Emily was quick to point a finger at Benjamin. Is she trying to divert attention from herself?] I agree with Benjamin. It's natural to feel nervous at the beginning of the game. However, we must pay close attention to how everyone acts and speaks during this discussion. That might give us some clues. We need to work together to uncover the werewolf.",

Let's bring up someone else as a potential suspect.] I agree with Sophia, we need to work together and pay attention to everyone's actions. Thomas, you've been very quick to jump into the discussion...almost like you have something to hide. Why are you so eager to find the werewolf? Are you trying to hide your guilt?",
        "Thomas: [Interesting, Victoria seems suspicious of me. I need to defend myself but also keep an eye on her.] Victoria, I appreciate your vigilance, but my eagerness comes from wanting to protect our village. As a fellow villager, I'm sure you understand the importance of finding the werewolf quickly. I'm just trying to help us all survive, and I have nothing to hide. Now, let's focus on finding the werewolf. Emily had suspicions about Benjamin earlier. Does anyone have more information or suspicions we should consider?",
        "Emily: [Thomas makes a good point, but we can't rule anybody out yet.] Victoria, your accusation towards Thomas seems a bit baseless right now. We must carefully observe everyone's behavior. I still think Benjamin's uneasiness is worth noting, but Sophia is right - we should pay attention to everyone's actions and words. If anyone has any other suspicions or evidence, now is the time to share it.",
        "Benjamin: [Victoria's a werewolf too, so we need to navigate this carefully.] You're right, Emily. It's important to keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions. Let's all think about any other interactions or behavior that seemed off. Defending each other without a proper reason might look suspicious. As for myself, I promise you that I'm just a nervous villager, and I want to help find the werewolf just like the rest of you.",
        "Sophia: [Victoria's accusation towards Thomas seemed a bit random. Is she trying to create chaos and confusion?] I appreciate everyone's commitment to finding the werewolf. We need to remain calm and think logically. Let's look back at our interactions and consider any odd behavior or inconsistencies. It's crucial that we make the right decision to protect our village. Remember, we are not enemies - the werewolf is.",
        "Victoria: [We need to create more suspicion around someone else and move the attention away from Benjamin and me.] I apologize if my previous accusation towards Thomas seemed baseless, but we need to consider all possibilities. Sophia, you've been very focused on keeping the peace and guiding the conversation, but we haven't heard much about your thoughts on who might be the werewolf. Do you have any suspicions? Or are you trying to maintain control and keep others from noticing something about you?",

I'm only trying to encourage a logical and thoughtful discussion to help us find the werewolf. As of now, I don't have strong suspicions about anyone. However, your accusatory behavior has caught my attention. I think we should all keep an eye on Victoria. What do the rest of you think?",
        "Thomas: [Victoria's accusations and Sophia's response are both worth considering. I should stay focused on gathering information to find the werewolf.] Sophia, I appreciate your effort to maintain a logical discussion, but we should also consider Victoria's points. It's important to explore all possibilities. That being said, let's continue to share any suspicions or information. Our top priority is finding and eliminating the werewolf. So far, we've talked about Benjamin and Victoria. Does anyone have thoughts on Emily or any other possibilities we haven't discussed?",

I'm not saying you're guilty, but it's worth considering. What do you think, Thomas and Sophia? We need to reach a decision soon.",
        "Sophia: [There's no concrete evidence against anyone yet, but Emily's initial accusation still stands out.] I hear you, Benjamin. Emily's quickness to accuse you was indeed suspicious. Thomas, you've been very involved in the discussion, which could be seen as either concern for the village or a tactic to shift attention. As for Victoria, her accusations have been quite random, making me uneasy. I think we should focus on Emily or Victoria for today's vote. We can't afford to waste more time. What do you all think?",
        "Thomas: [Emily accused Benjamin without much evidence, possibly to shift attention. Victoria has been randomly accusatory, making her suspicious as well. Sophia has been more consistent and logical in her reasoning. Considering all of this, I think Victoria's behavior has been the most concerning.]\nVictoria",
        "Emily: [My gut tells me Victoria's random accusations were suspicious, but Benjamin's uneasiness is still on my mind. Sophia provided a valuable perspective during the discussion, so I trust her judgment for now. I have to make a decision.] Victoria",
        "Benjamin: [Victoria and I are on the same team, so I can't vote for her. To avoid suspicion, I'll vote for Emily, since her accusation against me could be perceived as suspicious.] Emily",
