        "Thomas:  Oh no, poor Bob! We need to find the werewolf responsible for this. I didn't see anything suspicious last night, did any of you notice anything unusual? We have to work together to protect our village.",
        "Emily:  Last night was so quiet, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary either. But we can't just sit around mourning Bob; we have to act decisively! Does anyone have any suspicions or reasons to believe someone here might be the werewolf?",
        "Benjamin:  I agree, we need to be vigilant and share any information we might have. I also didn't see anything suspicious last night, but we should discuss each person's alibi and see if there's any inconsistency. We must find the werewolf before they kill again.",
        "Sophia:  I didn't notice anything unusual last night either, but we need to be proactive in our investigation. Let's consider everyone's behavior and try to find any clues that might help us. We can't afford to lose more villagers.",
        "Victoria:  Last night was eerily calm, I agree. Perhaps the werewolf took advantage of that, hoping we'd all be caught off guard. But I think it's crucial that we look for any subtle changes in each other's behavior. We can't assume the werewolf will be blatantly obvious. Has anyone observed anything even remotely strange or out-of-place since we met?",
        "Thomas:  You're right, Victoria. We need to be observant and look for anything out of the ordinary. In fact, I noticed that Sophia seemed a bit nervous today, maybe even agitated. I'm not accusing her, but it's something worth keeping an eye on. What does everyone think about that?",
        "Sophia:  Thomas, I appreciate your vigilance, but my nervousness is only due to the gravity of the situation. I'm concerned about our village, and I want to make sure we find the werewolf. But I think it's important that we continue to examine everyone's behavior and look for any inconsistencies. So let's keep the discussion going.",
        "Emily:  Thomas, I understand where you're coming from, but I think we all are a bit on edge given the circumstances. It doesn't necessarily make Sophia the werewolf. We need something more concrete. Let's continue examining each other's behavior and share any relevant information. We must work as a team to find the werewolf.",
        "Benjamin:  I understand both points of view, but we can't ignore any potential leads. Sophia, can you tell us what you were doing last night and if you interacted with anyone? It's important we examine every detail, and your cooperation could help us rule you out as a suspect.",
        "Sophia:  Of course, Benjamin, I understand the importance of cooperation. Last night, I was at home, knitting by the fireplace. I didn't interact with anyone or leave my house. If anyone saw me or wants to corroborate my story, I would appreciate it. But I encourage everyone to share their alibis as well, so we can piece together a better understanding of everyone's actions last night.",
        "Victoria:  Last night, I was reading a book in my house. I didn't see or interact with anyone either. However, I agree with Sophia; we should all share our alibis. For example, Emily, what were you doing last night? Let's focus on gathering more information and see if any inconsistencies arise.",
        "Emily:  Last night, I was in my house, too, cooking dinner and doing some chores. I didn't see or interact with anyone during the night. I think it's crucial that we all share our alibis, like Sophia and Victoria mentioned. Benjamin and Thomas, what were your whereabouts last night? The more information we have, the better chance we have of finding the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: Of course, Emily. Transparency is key in this situation. Last night, I was working on some woodcarving in my house. I didn't venture outside or interact with anyone. I completely agree that we should all share our alibis, so Benjamin, it's your turn. The sooner we have all the information, the better equipped we'll be to make an informed decision.",
        "Benjamin:  Last night, I was at home as well, repairing a broken chair. I didn't see or interact with anyone either. It seems we all had rather uneventful evenings. We need to dig deeper and look for any possible inconsistencies or odd behaviors among us. The werewolf is hiding in plain sight, and we must be diligent in our pursuit.",
        "Victoria:  Indeed, it seems we all had fairly normal evenings. But we must not overlook even the smallest details. For example, Benjamin, how long did it take you to repair that chair? It's important we account for every moment of our time last night. That way, we can piece together any inconsistencies and find the werewolf.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [Bob's death is unfortunate, but I must play it cool and divert suspicion.] Oh no, poor Bob! We need to find the werewolf responsible for this. I didn't see anything suspicious last night, did any of you notice anything unusual? We have to work together to protect our village.",
        "Emily: [Hmm, Thomas is trying to take charge, but it's too early to make any judgments. I should share any observations I had.] Last night was so quiet, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary either. But we can't just sit around mourning Bob; we have to act decisively! Does anyone have any suspicions or reasons to believe someone here might be the werewolf?",
        "Benjamin: [This is terrible news. I must gather my thoughts and try to identify any clues.] I agree, we need to be vigilant and share any information we might have. I also didn't see anything suspicious last night, but we should discuss each person's alibi and see if there's any inconsistency. We must find the werewolf before they kill again.",
        "Sophia: [We have to think carefully and make our assumptions clear.] I didn't notice anything unusual last night either, but we need to be proactive in our investigation. Let's consider everyone's behavior and try to find any clues that might help us. We can't afford to lose more villagers.",
        "Victoria: [Alright, I need to appear innocent and divert suspicion away from myself and Thomas. Let's start by throwing out an alternative theory.] Last night was eerily calm, I agree. Perhaps the werewolf took advantage of that, hoping we'd all be caught off guard. But I think it's crucial that we look for any subtle changes in each other's behavior. We can't assume the werewolf will be blatantly obvious. Has anyone observed anything even remotely strange or out-of-place since we met?",
        "Thomas: [I need to keep suspicion off of Victoria and myself. Time to subtly cast doubt on someone else.] You're right, Victoria. We need to be observant and look for anything out of the ordinary. In fact, I noticed that Sophia seemed a bit nervous today, maybe even agitated. I'm not accusing her, but it's something worth keeping an eye on. What does everyone think about that?",
        "Sophia: [Thomas' observation about my behavior could make suspicion fall on me. I need to address this calmly and make sure to remain as transparent as possible.] Thomas, I appreciate your vigilance, but my nervousness is only due to the gravity of the situation. I'm concerned about our village, and I want to make sure we find the werewolf. But I think it's important that we continue to examine everyone's behavior and look for any inconsistencies. So let's keep the discussion going.",
        "Emily: [Thomas pointed out Sophia's nervousness, but is that really a good reason to suspect her? I should share my thoughts and keep the conversation moving.] Thomas, I understand where you're coming from, but I think we all are a bit on edge given the circumstances. It doesn't necessarily make Sophia the werewolf. We need something more concrete. Let's continue examining each other's behavior and share any relevant information. We must work as a team to find the werewolf.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas might be onto something with Sophia, but Emily is right; we all seem on edge. Still, I need to be aggressive in my approach.] I understand both points of view, but we can't ignore any potential leads. Sophia, can you tell us what you were doing last night and if you interacted with anyone? It's important we examine every detail, and your cooperation could help us rule you out as a suspect.",
        "Sophia: [It's crucial to be transparent and provide any information that might help the group deduce the werewolf's identity.] Of course, Benjamin, I understand the importance of cooperation. Last night, I was at home, knitting by the fireplace. I didn't interact with anyone or leave my house. If anyone saw me or wants to corroborate my story, I would appreciate it. But I encourage everyone to share their alibis as well, so we can piece together a better understanding of everyone's actions last night.",
        "Victoria: [Okay, it's time to come up with a solid alibi and maybe try to cast some doubt on someone else.] Last night, I was reading a book in my house. I didn't see or interact with anyone either. However, I agree with Sophia; we should all share our alibis. For example, Emily, what were you doing last night? Let's focus on gathering more information and see if any inconsistencies arise.",
        "Emily: [Victoria is asking for my alibi, so I should be honest and cooperative.] Last night, I was in my house, too, cooking dinner and doing some chores. I didn't see or interact with anyone during the night. I think it's crucial that we all share our alibis, like Sophia and Victoria mentioned. Benjamin and Thomas, what were your whereabouts last night? The more information we have, the better chance we have of finding the werewolf.",

        "Benjamin: [I need to be forthcoming and share my alibi to maintain trust.] Last night, I was at home as well, repairing a broken chair. I didn't see or interact with anyone either. It seems we all had rather uneventful evenings. We need to dig deeper and look for any possible inconsistencies or odd behaviors among us. The werewolf is hiding in plain sight, and we must be diligent in our pursuit.",
        "Victoria: [This could be our opportunity to cast suspicion on someone else.] Indeed, it seems we all had fairly normal evenings. But we must not overlook even the smallest details. For example, Benjamin, how long did it take you to repair that chair? It's important we account for every moment of our time last night. That way, we can piece together any inconsistencies and find the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: [This is a crucial moment. I need to cast suspicion on someone else without drawing attention to Victoria or myself. Sophia seems like the most vulnerable target, and her nervousness could work in our favor.]\n\nI vote for Sophia.",
        "Emily: [Although all alibis seemed normal, Thomas was quite fast to point out Sophia's nervousness. I should take a calculated risk here. What if Thomas is trying to divert attention from himself? He was also the first to share his alibi, maybe trying to appear innocent. I have to choose between Benjamin, Thomas, and Victoria. I'll vote for Thomas.]\n\nI vote for Thomas.",
        "Benjamin: [Benjamin thinks: Let's see. Thomas brought up the suspicion on Sophia, but Emily was quick to dismiss it. Victoria seems very detail-oriented, but is she just trying to deflect attention from herself? It's a difficult decision, but I need to make a calculated choice.]\n\nI vote for Victoria.",
        "Sophia: [We don't have any solid evidence, but we must vote. Based on their behavior, I'm inclined to suspect Thomas. He was quick to point out my nervousness as suspicious, but it could be an attempt to divert attention from himself. It's a difficult decision, but I must vote.]\n\nI vote for Thomas.",
        "Victoria: [This is a critical moment. I can't vote for Thomas since he's a werewolf too. It's essential that I choose someone else and have the right reasoning behind it.]\n\nI vote for Benjamin."
