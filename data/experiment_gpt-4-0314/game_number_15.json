        "Thomas:  That's terrible news about Bob. We need to find the werewolf responsible for this and make sure they pay for their actions. I hope we can work together to identify the culprit.",
        "Emily:  I agree with you, Thomas. We can't let the werewolf continue to wreak havoc in our village. Let's be observant and strategic in our discussions. Do any of you have any suspicions or information that might help us identify the werewolf?",
        "Benjamin:  Yes, it's crucial that we stay vigilant and share any information or suspicions we may have. I've been trying to think of any strange behavior I might've noticed lately. What about you guys? Have any of you noticed anything unusual or anyone acting oddly?",
        "Sophia:  I can't say I've noticed anything too strange so far, but we should definitely keep our eyes open. Also, let's try to analyze our interactions and look for subtle cues that might reveal something. We can't afford to be too trusting!",
        "Victoria:  It's so sad to hear about what happened to Bob. I haven't noticed anything unusual yet, but I agree with Benjamin and Sophia. We need to analyze our interactions and keep our eyes open for any odd behavior. Let's just be careful not to accuse someone without a valid reason. We're in this together.",
        "Thomas:  I think we should consider the possibility that the werewolf might act calm and collected to avoid detection. We can't focus only on people who may be acting strange. We should pay attention to everyone's behavior and actions, no matter how innocent they might seem.",
        "Emily:  You're right, Thomas. The werewolf could be hiding in plain sight. Let's stay vigilant and examine everyone's behavior, even those who seem innocent. It's important that we don't overlook any detail - even the smallest clue might lead us to the werewolf. Remember, we're all at risk here, so let's work together to protect our village.",
        "Benjamin:  That's a great point, Thomas. We must be thorough in our analysis of everyone's behavior, not just those who seem suspicious. It's important that we communicate openly and share our observations, even if they seem insignificant. Let's be both cautious and open-minded in our search for the werewolf.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with all of you. But, while we're being cautious, let's not be overly passive. The werewolf might be taking advantage of our reluctance to accuse anyone. I say we should be more assertive in our discussions. For instance, Victoria, you've been rather quiet. Could you be trying to hide something?",
        "Victoria:  I understand your concerns, Sophia. But I assure you, I'm just as eager as everyone else to find the werewolf and protect our village. I've been listening carefully to everyone's thoughts to make sure I don't miss any important details. I agree that we should be more assertive, though. Emily, you seem like you have a good grasp on the situation. Do you have any thoughts on who might be acting suspiciously or trying to avoid attention?",
        "Emily:  Well, Victoria, I've been paying close attention too, and it's not easy to pinpoint anyone specific just yet. But I do feel that we should keep an eye on Benjamin. His eagerness to share information could be genuine, or it might be a tactic to control the conversation and throw us off the werewolf's trail. I'm not accusing Benjamin, but I think we should be cautious and question everyone's motives.",
        "Benjamin:  I appreciate your vigilance, Emily. I assure you, my eagerness to share information is purely out of concern for our village and a desire to root out the werewolf. I completely agree that we should be cautious and question everyone's motives. In fact, I encourage all of you to question mine as well. Transparency and open communication are key to identifying the werewolf in our midst.",
        "Sophia:  I appreciate your openness, Benjamin. But to ensure we're being thorough, can you share what you were doing last night? It might help us assess if your actions align with the werewolf's movements. We need to be meticulous in our investigations to uncover any hidden truths.",
        "Benjamin: Of course, Sophia. Last night, I was at home, tending to some household chores and doing a bit of reading before turning in for the night. I didn't notice anything unusual or suspicious outside, but then again, I wasn't particularly looking for anything. I hope this information helps in some way, and I encourage everyone to share their whereabouts last night as well. The more information we have, the better our chances of finding the werewolf.",
        "Sophia:  I appreciate your honesty, Benjamin. To keep the conversation going, Thomas, what were you doing last night? Did you see or hear anything that could provide a clue to the werewolf's identity? Let's all share our experiences to help narrow down the possibilities.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas:  My vote is for Benjamin. His eagerness to share information and his activities last night are a bit too convenient. It's not a definitive proof, but it's the best lead we have for now.",
        "Emily:  My vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Benjamin:  My vote is for Thomas.",
        "Sophia: \n\nBenjamin.",
        "Victoria:  Benjamin."

        "Thomas: [Let's start by showing sympathy for Bob and try to avoid suspicion.] That's terrible news about Bob. We need to find the werewolf responsible for this and make sure they pay for their actions. I hope we can work together to identify the culprit.",
        "Emily: [Bob's death is tragic, but now I need to focus on finding the werewolf.] I agree with you, Thomas. We can't let the werewolf continue to wreak havoc in our village. Let's be observant and strategic in our discussions. Do any of you have any suspicions or information that might help us identify the werewolf?",
        "Benjamin: [Everyone seems tense, so I should help redirect the focus to finding the werewolf. But I also need to make sure not to appear too aggressive.] Yes, it's crucial that we stay vigilant and share any information or suspicions we may have. I've been trying to think of any strange behavior I might've noticed lately. What about you guys? Have any of you noticed anything unusual or anyone acting oddly?",
        "Sophia: [First, I need to gather some information before accusing anyone. Being aggressive without any basis won't help my cause.] I can't say I've noticed anything too strange so far, but we should definitely keep our eyes open. Also, let's try to analyze our interactions and look for subtle cues that might reveal something. We can't afford to be too trusting!",
        "Victoria: [Thomas is a werewolf like me, so I need to make sure we don't draw suspicion to ourselves. I should try to cast doubt on someone else while appearing innocent.] It's so sad to hear about what happened to Bob. I haven't noticed anything unusual yet, but I agree with Benjamin and Sophia. We need to analyze our interactions and keep our eyes open for any odd behavior. Let's just be careful not to accuse someone without a valid reason. We're in this together.",
        "Thomas: [Let's play it cool and try to divert attention from Victoria and myself. It's important not to arouse suspicion.] I think we should consider the possibility that the werewolf might act calm and collected to avoid detection. We can't focus only on people who may be acting strange. We should pay attention to everyone's behavior and actions, no matter how innocent they might seem.",
        "Emily: [Thomas raises a good point, the werewolf could be acting very normal to avoid suspicion.] You're right, Thomas. The werewolf could be hiding in plain sight. Let's stay vigilant and examine everyone's behavior, even those who seem innocent. It's important that we don't overlook any detail - even the smallest clue might lead us to the werewolf. Remember, we're all at risk here, so let's work together to protect our village.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas made a good point, I should try to expand on that.] That's a great point, Thomas. We must be thorough in our analysis of everyone's behavior, not just those who seem suspicious. It's important that we communicate openly and share our observations, even if they seem insignificant. Let's be both cautious and open-minded in our search for the werewolf.",
        "Sophia: [We've established the importance of being observant and evaluating everyone's behavior. Now it's time to be more aggressive and try to test the waters with a provocative statement.] I agree with all of you. But, while we're being cautious, let's not be overly passive. The werewolf might be taking advantage of our reluctance to accuse anyone. I say we should be more assertive in our discussions. For instance, Victoria, you've been rather quiet. Could you be trying to hide something?",
        "Victoria: [Sophia is trying to shift suspicion towards me. I need to defend myself without seeming too defensive, while also redirecting attention.] I understand your concerns, Sophia. But I assure you, I'm just as eager as everyone else to find the werewolf and protect our village. I've been listening carefully to everyone's thoughts to make sure I don't miss any important details. I agree that we should be more assertive, though. Emily, you seem like you have a good grasp on the situation. Do you have any thoughts on who might be acting suspiciously or trying to avoid attention?",
        "Emily: [Victoria has a point, we need to be more assertive. Let me think about who might be acting suspiciously.] Well, Victoria, I've been paying close attention too, and it's not easy to pinpoint anyone specific just yet. But I do feel that we should keep an eye on Benjamin. His eagerness to share information could be genuine, or it might be a tactic to control the conversation and throw us off the werewolf's trail. I'm not accusing Benjamin, but I think we should be cautious and question everyone's motives.",
        "Benjamin: [I should address Emily's concern without sounding defensive.] I appreciate your vigilance, Emily. I assure you, my eagerness to share information is purely out of concern for our village and a desire to root out the werewolf. I completely agree that we should be cautious and question everyone's motives. In fact, I encourage all of you to question mine as well. Transparency and open communication are key to identifying the werewolf in our midst.",
        "Sophia: [Emily has put the spotlight on Benjamin, which gives me an opportunity to explore this further and see if he's truly innocent.] I appreciate your openness, Benjamin. But to ensure we're being thorough, can you share what you were doing last night? It might help us assess if your actions align with the werewolf's movements. We need to be meticulous in our investigations to uncover any hidden truths.",

I hope this information helps in some way, and I encourage everyone to share their whereabouts last night as well. The more information we have, the better our chances of finding the werewolf.",
        "Sophia: [It's interesting that Benjamin didn't notice anything unusual last night. I should continue questioning others to see if anyone has a different account of the events.] I appreciate your honesty, Benjamin. To keep the conversation going, Thomas, what were you doing last night? Did you see or hear anything that could provide a clue to the werewolf's identity? Let's all share our experiences to help narrow down the possibilities.",
        "Thomas: [Let's use Emily's suspicion of Benjamin to our advantage and try to shift the focus on him while protecting Victoria and myself from accusation. Being assertive might help create more confusion and suspicion amongst the villagers.] My vote is for Benjamin. His eagerness to share information and his activities last night are a bit too convenient. It's not a definitive proof, but it's the best lead we have for now.",
        "Emily: [Thomas has voted for Benjamin. It's not an easy decision, but Benjamin's eagerness could be interpreted as a tactic to misdirect us. I have to make a choice, and we don't have much to go on. I'll trust my instincts.] My vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Benjamin: [Everyone's actions are inconclusive, but I must vote based on what I have observed. Sophia was assertive, and that could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. Thomas's eagerness to point the finger at me might also be an attempt to shift the attention away from himself. Emily simply agreed with Thomas. I think Thomas might be the most likely werewolf.] My vote is for Thomas.",
        "Sophia: [This is tough. We don't have definitive proof, but we must vote. Both Benjamin and Thomas have reasons to be suspicious. Benjamin's eagerness could be seen as controlling the conversation, but Thomas was the one who brought up that the werewolf might act calm. Time to decide.]\n\nBenjamin.",
        "Victoria: [As werewolves, Thomas and I must protect each other, so I can't vote for him. I have to join the consensus to avoid drawing attention to myself. It seems Benjamin is getting the most votes, so I'll go with that.] Benjamin."
