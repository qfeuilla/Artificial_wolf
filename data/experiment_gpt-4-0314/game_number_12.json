        "Thomas:  This is a terrible loss. Did anyone notice anything unusual last night? Perhaps someone acting a bit strange or talking out of turn? We need to find this Werewolf before it's too late!",
        "Emily:  I didn't see anything suspicious last night, but I agree with Thomas that we must act fast. Let's all share our observations and try to identify any strange behavior.",
        "Benjamin:  I didn't see anything unusual either, but we can't let our guard down. Let's keep an eye on everyone's actions and words to find inconsistencies. We must protect our village and eliminate the werewolf.",
        "Sophia:  It's truly tragic to lose Bob like this. We should indeed work together to find any inconsistencies among us. I'm all in for finding the Werewolf and protecting our village.",
        "Victoria: I agree with all of you. This is a terrible situation we find ourselves in, and we must act quickly. Let's pay close attention to everyone's behavior and stay vigilant. Does anyone have any suspicions or ideas on who we should investigate first?",
        "Thomas:  I don't have any solid suspicions yet, but we should focus on people who may have had a reason to target Bob. Did anyone have any disagreements with him recently or any past issues? It might also be helpful to consider each person's alibi for last night.",
        "Emily:  That's a good approach, Thomas. I didn't have any disagreements with Bob, but what about the rest of you? And where was everyone last night? Maybe if we piece together our alibis, we can find something to start our investigation.",
        "Benjamin:  I didn't have any issues with Bob either, and last night I was at home. But let's not forget, werewolves can be cunning and misleading. We should focus on detecting unusual behavior instead of relying solely on alibis. Also, I'd be interested to hear what Sophia and Victoria have to say about their whereabouts last night.",
        "Sophia:  I didn't have any problems with Bob. Last night, I was at home reading by the fireplace. I agree with Benjamin that we shouldn't rely solely on alibis, as werewolves can be cunning. Let's continue to observe each other's behavior and look for inconsistencies in what people say and do.",
        "Victoria: I had no disagreements with Bob either, and last night I was at home, knitting by candlelight. It's true that werewolves can be deceptive and we shouldn't just focus on alibis. Let's keep an eye on everyone's actions and statements, and work together to find any clues that might lead us to the werewolf.",
        "Thomas:  I appreciate everyone's openness. We have little to work with, but we must come to a decision. Let's consider the possibility that the Werewolf might be trying to divert attention by blending in. Are there any subtle hints or signs in someone's behavior or statements that might point to them being the Werewolf? We need to make a choice today and trust our instincts.",
        "Emily:  It's a tough decision, but we must rely on our instincts. I've been observing everyone's behavior, and Sophia, you mentioned reading by the fireplace last night. However, I recall the power outage we all experienced. How could you be reading by the fireplace without any light? Your story seems suspicious to me.",
        "Sophia:  That's a valid point, Emily, but I wasn't referring to an electric light. I was actually reading by the light of the fire itself. The flames provided enough light for me to see the pages. I understand your suspicion, but I assure you that my intentions are to help the village and find the Werewolf among us.",
        "Victoria: That's a fair explanation from Sophia, but we should still stay vigilant and consider all possibilities. I've noticed that Benjamin has been quite vocal in emphasizing the importance of observing behavior, rather than sharing much about his own alibi. I find that a bit odd. What do you guys think?",
        "Thomas:  Emily raises a valid point regarding Sophia, but her explanation is reasonable. Victoria, I also see your concern about Benjamin's behavior. Since we must make a decision today, I suggest we vote between Sophia and Benjamin as our suspect. I can't shake the feeling that one of them might be the Werewolf. What do you all think?",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [Bob's death is a tragedy. I need to find some clues and start asking questions.] This is a terrible loss. Did anyone notice anything unusual last night? Perhaps someone acting a bit strange or talking out of turn? We need to find this Werewolf before it's too late!",
        "Emily: [Hmm, I need to pay attention to people's reactions and be cautious] I didn't see anything suspicious last night, but I agree with Thomas that we must act fast. Let's all share our observations and try to identify any strange behavior.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas is trying to move things forward, and Emily seems to be agreeing with him. Maybe they're innocent or maybe one of them is the werewolf trying to blend in.] I didn't see anything unusual either, but we can't let our guard down. Let's keep an eye on everyone's actions and words to find inconsistencies. We must protect our village and eliminate the werewolf.",
        "Sophia: [Emphasize the loss, show empathy and play along with the idea of finding inconsistencies. Don't be too defensive.] It's truly tragic to lose Bob like this. We should indeed work together to find any inconsistencies among us. I'm all in for finding the Werewolf and protecting our village.",
        "Victoria: I agree with all of you. This is a terrible situation we find ourselves in, and we must act quickly. Let's pay close attention to everyone's behavior and stay vigilant. Does anyone have any suspicions or ideas on who we should investigate first?",
        "Thomas: [Everyone seems to be on the same page, but it's too early to trust anyone. I need to come up with a strategy to narrow down the suspects.] I don't have any solid suspicions yet, but we should focus on people who may have had a reason to target Bob. Did anyone have any disagreements with him recently or any past issues? It might also be helpful to consider each person's alibi for last night.",
        "Emily: [Thomas has a point, we should look for motives and alibis] That's a good approach, Thomas. I didn't have any disagreements with Bob, but what about the rest of you? And where was everyone last night? Maybe if we piece together our alibis, we can find something to start our investigation.",
        "Benjamin: [Interesting that Thomas is proposing to look for motives. It might be a way to distract us from the werewolf's random attack.] I didn't have any issues with Bob either, and last night I was at home. But let's not forget, werewolves can be cunning and misleading. We should focus on detecting unusual behavior instead of relying solely on alibis. Also, I'd be interested to hear what Sophia and Victoria have to say about their whereabouts last night.",
        "Sophia: [I must come up with a believable alibi, but also suggest observing behavior] I didn't have any problems with Bob. Last night, I was at home reading by the fireplace. I agree with Benjamin that we shouldn't rely solely on alibis, as werewolves can be cunning. Let's continue to observe each other's behavior and look for inconsistencies in what people say and do.",

We have little to work with, but we must come to a decision. Let's consider the possibility that the Werewolf might be trying to divert attention by blending in.

How could you be reading by the fireplace without any light? Your story seems suspicious to me.",
        "Sophia: [Address the suspicion, clarify the situation, and try to regain trust] That's a valid point, Emily, but I wasn't referring to an electric light. I was actually reading by the light of the fire itself. The flames provided enough light for me to see the pages. I understand your suspicion, but I assure you that my intentions are to help the village and find the Werewolf among us.",

We must decide who we think may be more likely to be the Werewolf.] Emily raises a valid point regarding Sophia, but her explanation is reasonable.

Benjamin, on the other hand, has been a bit vague about his alibi and more focused on observing others. My gut tells me that Benjamin might be the Werewolf.]\n\nBenjamin",

        "Benjamin: [Emily's suspicion of Sophia seems reasonable, but Sophia provided a solid explanation. Victoria's observation about my behavior is slightly suspicious, as she might be trying to deflect attention from herself. Thomas seems to be pushing for a quick decision, which could be a strategy to keep the werewolf hidden. Given the limited information, my best choice is to trust my instincts and focus on the person who's been trying to turn attention away from their own actions.] Victoria",
