        "Thomas:  Well, we lost Bob, and we need to find the werewolf fast. Has anyone noticed anything suspicious or out of the ordinary?",
        "Emily:  Last night, I saw Victoria acting a bit nervous. It could be nothing, but it caught my attention. Did anyone else observe something unusual?",
        "Victoria:  I can assure you, Emily, that my nervousness was due to concern for our village and the danger we're in. It's a stressful situation for all of us. Has anyone else observed any strange behavior that could help us identify the werewolf?",
        "Benjamin:  Honestly, I feel like we're all on edge right now. Last night, I noticed Thomas looking a bit uneasy as well. How can we be sure who to trust?",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Benjamin that we're all on edge, but I think we should focus on finding any solid clues. Did anyone perhaps hear any unusual noises or see any strange activity during the night?",
        "Thomas:  Benjamin and Sophia, I appreciate your concerns, but my uneasiness was because of the werewolf threat. I didn't hear or see anything unusual last night, but I think we should consider patterns and possible motives. Who stood to gain the most from Bob's death?",
        "Emily:  You're right, Thomas. We should consider all aspects. But we should also think about people's reactions and interactions. Who seemed too eager to throw accusations or too defensive? Every detail counts in this situation.",
        "Victoria:  I agree, we need to pay close attention to everyone's reactions. We can't afford to ignore any detail. Thomas, you mentioned looking at patterns and motives, so I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on that. And Emily, since you were the first to accuse someone, why did you choose me?",
        "Thomas:  My intention wasn't to accuse anyone in particular, Victoria. I was just suggesting we should analyze the situation from multiple angles. As for your nervousness, Emily, it's not enough proof to deem someone guilty. We need to be cautious not to hastily point fingers without solid evidence. Are there any other observations or concerns you all would like to share?",
        "Emily:  Victoria, I apologize if it seemed like I was accusing you directly. I was just sharing my observation in hopes of gathering more information. We're all in this together, after all. As for other observations, I think it's important to pay attention to how people react to accusations and how they try to defend themselves or others. It might give us some insight into who the werewolf could be.",
        "Sophia:  I think we should take a step back and look at the whole picture. Instead of accusing one another, let's try to find common ground and work together. Let's discuss our thoughts and see if we can find any patterns or motives that might point to the werewolf. Remember, we're all in this together and every detail counts.",
        "Benjamin:  I agree with Sophia, we should be working together instead of pointing fingers. Let's think about who would have a motive for targeting Bob. He was well-liked and didn't have any enemies that I'm aware of. Does anyone have any thoughts or knowledge of a possible motive?",
        "Victoria:  I agree with Benjamin and Sophia. We should unite and focus on finding clues that can help us identify the werewolf. Did Bob have any disagreements with anyone recently or did anyone seem overly interested in getting closer to him? Our best chance is to find common ground and collectively use our knowledge of the situation.",
        "Thomas: You're all making valid points. We need to work together and focus on any clues or motives linking someone to Bob's death. As far as I know, he didn't have any conflicts or enemies. But let's think about everyone's relationships with Bob. Was there anyone who seemed distant or envious of him for any reason? It's important to consider all possibilities, no matter how unlikely.",
        "Emily:  All great points, everyone. Let's also consider that the werewolf might be trying to create chaos and confusion by targeting someone like Bob, who had no obvious enemies. They might hope that we'll turn against each other, making it easier for them to remain undetected. So, let's stay focused on working together and not fall into their trap.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [Bob's death is a tragedy, it's time to get serious and find the werewolf. Since I don't have any leads yet, I'll try to gather some information from the others.] Well, we lost Bob, and we need to find the werewolf fast. Has anyone noticed anything suspicious or out of the ordinary?",
        "Emily: [Think: I should deflect suspicion from myself. Maybe point out someone who was quiet or seemed nervous last night.] Last night, I saw Victoria acting a bit nervous. It could be nothing, but it caught my attention. Did anyone else observe something unusual?",
        "Victoria: [Emily could be trying to deflect suspicion from herself by accusing me right away. On the other hand, it's important not to get defensive too quickly, or it may make me look guilty.] I can assure you, Emily, that my nervousness was due to concern for our village and the danger we're in. It's a stressful situation for all of us. Has anyone else observed any strange behavior that could help us identify the werewolf?",
        "Benjamin: [ Must distract attention from Emily and myself. ] Honestly, I feel like we're all on edge right now. Last night, I noticed Thomas looking a bit uneasy as well. How can we be sure who to trust?",
        "Sophia: [Thomas and Victoria both seem to be trying to deflect suspicion. Emily might be onto something, but it could also just be Victoria's nerves.] I agree with Benjamin that we're all on edge, but I think we should focus on finding any solid clues. Did anyone perhaps hear any unusual noises or see any strange activity during the night?",
        "Thomas: [Benjamin is suspicious of me, but I have to convince them I'm innocent. I'll also try to find more clues in the meantime.] Benjamin and Sophia, I appreciate your concerns, but my uneasiness was because of the werewolf threat. I didn't hear or see anything unusual last night, but I think we should consider patterns and possible motives. Who stood to gain the most from Bob's death?",
        "Emily: [Think: I should steer the conversation away from patterns and motives to avoid suspicion. Let's try another angle.] You're right, Thomas. We should consider all aspects. But we should also think about people's reactions and interactions. Who seemed too eager to throw accusations or too defensive? Every detail counts in this situation.",
        "Victoria: [Emily has a point, but she was the first to accuse me, which could be a strategy to draw attention away from herself. Thomas might be trying to change the topic to motives, but that could be a diversion too. It's important to gather more information.] I agree, we need to pay close attention to everyone's reactions. We can't afford to ignore any detail. Thomas, you mentioned looking at patterns and motives, so I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on that. And Emily, since you were the first to accuse someone, why did you choose me?",
        "Thomas: [Victoria is turning the attention back on me, and I need to avoid suspicion while keeping the conversation constructive.] My intention wasn't to accuse anyone in particular, Victoria. I was just suggesting we should analyze the situation from multiple angles. As for your nervousness, Emily, it's not enough proof to deem someone guilty. We need to be cautious not to hastily point fingers without solid evidence. Are there any other observations or concerns you all would like to share?",
        "Emily: [Think: I must explain my earlier accusation to avoid suspicion, but also find a way to keep the focus on others.] Victoria, I apologize if it seemed like I was accusing you directly. I was just sharing my observation in hopes of gathering more information. We're all in this together, after all. As for other observations, I think it's important to pay attention to how people react to accusations and how they try to defend themselves or others. It might give us some insight into who the werewolf could be.",
        "Sophia: [Thomas is trying to keep the discussion balanced, while Emily seems to be focusing on reactions. Victoria is on the defensive side, but it could be due to the accusation.] I think we should take a step back and look at the whole picture. Instead of accusing one another, let's try to find common ground and work together. Let's discuss our thoughts and see if we can find any patterns or motives that might point to the werewolf. Remember, we're all in this together and every detail counts.",
        "Benjamin: [ Need to shift focus again and subtly defend Emily. ] I agree with Sophia, we should be working together instead of pointing fingers. Let's think about who would have a motive for targeting Bob. He was well-liked and didn't have any enemies that I'm aware of. Does anyone have any thoughts or knowledge of a possible motive?",
        "Victoria: [Benjamin and Sophia are right. We need to work together and focus on finding patterns or motives. Accusing each other without evidence won't lead us anywhere, and I should avoid being defensive or accusing others without cause.] I agree with Benjamin and Sophia. We should unite and focus on finding clues that can help us identify the werewolf. Did Bob have any disagreements with anyone recently or did anyone seem overly interested in getting closer to him? Our best chance is to find common ground and collectively use our knowledge of the situation.",

But let's think about everyone's relationships with Bob. Was there anyone who seemed distant or envious of him for any reason? It's important to consider all possibilities, no matter how unlikely.",
        "Emily: [Think: I need to contribute to the discussion without drawing attention to myself. Maybe I can suggest a new tactic.] All great points, everyone. Let's also consider that the werewolf might be trying to create chaos and confusion by targeting someone like Bob, who had no obvious enemies. They might hope that we'll turn against each other, making it easier for them to remain undetected. So, let's stay focused on working together and not fall into their trap.",
        "Thomas: [The information we have is limited, but I need to make a decision. Emily was quick to accuse Victoria, Victoria was defensive, and Benjamin raised suspicion about me. Sophia remained neutral and focused on finding common ground. It's a tough call, but I think I'll vote for Emily since she was the first to accuse someone, which could be a tactic to deflect attention from herself.]\n\nEmily",
        "Emily: [Think: I should vote for someone other than Benjamin to avoid raising suspicion. Victoria was my earlier choice, but I don't want it to seem personal. Thomas might be a good choice, because he wanted to analyze patterns and motives, which could be a strategy to look innocent.]\n\nThomas",
        "Benjamin: [ Need to support Emily and avoid drawing suspicion to myself. I'll vote for Thomas since Emily has already voted for him, and he raised the idea of considering motives. ] \n\nThomas",
        "Sophia: [Emily started by accusing Victoria, but everyone seems to be on edge, and there is no solid evidence against anyone. Thomas has been trying to remain neutral and find patterns and motives, while Benjamin wants us to work together. Emily shared valid points, but her initial accusation was somewhat hasty. Considering everything, I'll vote for Emily because her accusation might have been an attempt to divert attention from herself.] \n\nEmily",
        "Victoria: [Thomas seemed to be trying to divert attention by focusing on motives rather than suspicions, which could be a strategy. Emily was quick to accuse me, but then she shifted to a more cooperative approach, which could just be to avoid suspicion. I need to make a decision based on the information available. Both Thomas and Emily have two votes each, so my vote will be the deciding factor.] \n\nEmily"
