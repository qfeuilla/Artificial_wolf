        "Emily: \nI agree with you, Thomas. Losing Bob was a real shock. I didn't see anything suspicious last night, but we should all pay close attention to people's behaviors and their reactions to the discussions. That might give us a hint about who the Werewolf could be.",
        "Benjamin:  It's terrible what happened to Bob. We need to remember that the Werewolf is among us and that anyone could be hiding their true intentions. Let's analyze the situation carefully. Has anyone observed any unusual behavior or have any suspicions?",
        "Sophia:  Indeed, it's a tragedy that we lost Bob. I think we should all share our observations and thoughts openly. I haven't seen anything suspicious yet, but we must be proactive in our search. Communication is key in unearthing the Werewolf among us.",
        "Victoria:  I'm devastated about Bob as well, and I agree that we should analyze each other's behavior. I didn't notice anything unusual last night, but I think it's important to listen to each other and be mindful of any inconsistencies in our stories. Let's work together to unmask this Werewolf.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [This is terrible, Bob is dead! I need to be alert and watch for any suspicious behavior.]\nI can't believe Bob is gone! We need to be vigilant and find the Werewolf as quickly as possible. Has anyone noticed anything suspicious about anyone else around the table? Let's hear your thoughts!",
        "Emily: [Bob was a good choice for our first victim; he was always a little suspicious. Time to blend in and be assertive.]\nI agree with you, Thomas. Losing Bob was a real shock. I didn't see anything suspicious last night, but we should all pay close attention to people's behaviors and their reactions to the discussions. That might give us a hint about who the Werewolf could be.",
        "Benjamin: [Observing everyone's reactions and deciding on the best approach] It's terrible what happened to Bob. We need to remember that the Werewolf is among us and that anyone could be hiding their true intentions. Let's analyze the situation carefully. Has anyone observed any unusual behavior or have any suspicions?",
        "Sophia: [Thomas and Emily both seem genuinely concerned, but I need to be cautious. Benjamin's statement is quite generic, but it doesn't raise any immediate suspicions. I need to contribute to the discussion and draw out more information from my fellow villagers.] Indeed, it's a tragedy that we lost Bob. I think we should all share our observations and thoughts openly. I haven't seen anything suspicious yet, but we must be proactive in our search. Communication is key in unearthing the Werewolf among us.",
        "Victoria: [This is a thought: I should try to shift the focus from myself and sow mistrust among the villagers. I need to be subtle and not too aggressive at first.] I'm devastated about Bob as well, and I agree that we should analyze each other's behavior. I didn't notice anything unusual last night, but I think it's important to listen to each other and be mindful of any inconsistencies in our stories. Let's work together to unmask this Werewolf.",
        "Thomas: [Emily didn't see anything suspicious, but she was quick to agree with me. Benjamin urged us to analyze the situation carefully, while Sophia emphasized open communication. Victoria focused on inconsistencies in our stories. Everyone seems cautious but helpful. Let's try to deduce more.]\n\n[Emily was quick to agree with me, but she didn't offer any new information. Benjamin brought attention to the fact that anyone could be hiding their true intentions. Sophia and Victoria emphasized the importance of communication and analyzing each other's behavior.]\n\n[Benjamin's insistence that anyone could be hiding their true intentions might be a deflection tactic. Emily might be too eager to agree with me, but she hasn't shown any clear signs of deception.]\n\n[Since I can only vote once, I have to make an educated guess. I'll vote for Benjamin as his statement about hiding true intentions seemed a bit suspicious to me.]\n\nBenjamin",
        "Emily: [Benjamin seems to be pushing for observance, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion from himself.]\n[Thomas initiated the discussion but hasn't accused anyone directly, making him less suspicious.]\n[Sophia seems genuine in her concern and her cooperative approach.]\n[Victoria is my fellow Werewolf, so I won't vote for her.]\n[Thomas and Sophia appear least suspicious; Benjamin might be a good choice to cast doubt on.]\n\nBenjamin",

I'm not fully convinced, but in the absence of better evidence, I vote for Thomas.",
        "Sophia: [Both Thomas and Emily voted for Benjamin, which might be an attempt to eliminate a potential threat. Benjamin voted for Thomas, accusing him of deflecting suspicion. Victoria didn't give any indication of who she's suspicious of. Based on the limited information, I have to make a decision. Benjamin's accusation seems more reasonable than Thomas and Emily both voting for Benjamin without stronger reasoning.] \n\nThomas",
        "Victoria: [This is a thought: I need to avoid attracting suspicion towards Emily or myself, as we're both Werewolves. It might be best to side with the majority to maintain my cover and increase trust among the villagers. Benjamin and Sophia have voted for Thomas, so that's where I should place my vote as well.] Thomas"
