        "Thomas:  \n\nI'm shocked about what happened to Bob! He was a good man. I overheard a strange noise coming from Emily's direction last night. Did anyone else notice that?",
        "Emily:  I'm devastated about Bob. That's terrible, Thomas, but I must admit, I didn't hear anything. Could this be paranoia setting in? Surely we have to look for more concrete evidence.",
        "Benjamin: Wow, I can't believe Bob is gone.  While it's possible that Emily was involved, I also think we should consider other possibilities. Sophia, Victoria, what do you have to say about last night? Did you see or hear anything unusual?",
        "Sophia:  I'm saddened by the loss of Bob, truly a tragedy. I didn't hear anything suspicious last night either, but it's vital we examine everyone's behavior and alibis. Victoria, do you have anything to add to this?",
        "Victoria:  Bob's death is truly heartbreaking. I didn't hear anything unusual last night, but I did notice Thomas seemed quite restless earlier. We need to keep our eyes and ears open, and work together as a village to find the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: \n\nIt's understandable that everyone is on edge, but I assure you, I was just anxious about the werewolf threat. We all must be cautious. Emily, I apologize if I jumped to conclusions, but we cannot ignore the possibility. Sophia, do you have any thoughts on who might be suspicious?",
        "Sophia:  No need to apologize, Thomas, we're all concerned about our safety. While I can't point fingers at anyone specific just yet, let's continue to discuss and observe each other's actions. Emily, do you have any insights or concerns you'd like to share?",
        "Emily:  No hard feelings, Thomas. We're all on edge. I don't have any solid suspicions yet, but I agree with Sophia. It's important that we continue to communicate and watch each other closely to identify any irregularities. Let's be vigilant and work together to find the werewolf.",
        "Benjamin: I'm glad we're all sharing our thoughts and working together.  Victoria, you mentioned Thomas was restless earlier. Could you tell us more about that? Meanwhile, Emily, since you don't have any solid suspicions, what criteria do you think we should use to evaluate each other? Perhaps there's something we're overlooking.",
        "Victoria:  Thomas was pacing back and forth outside his house, which could be just a result of anxiety given the situation. As for evaluating each other, I agree with Emily and Sophia. We should watch for any unusual behavior and inconsistencies in our testimonies. Let's be alert and keep discussing our observations to find the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: \n\nBenjamin, I appreciate your help in getting more information. As for my pacing, I couldn't sleep due to the werewolf threat. Emily, Victoria, and Sophia have made valid points about being observant. Victoria, did you notice anything about anyone else's behavior that could be suspicious?",
        "Victoria:  While I didn't see anything explicitly suspicious last night, I did notice that Benjamin seemed quite preoccupied during the day. However, given the circumstances, this could be just another case of nerves. We must remember that the werewolf might be very good at blending in, so we should focus on scrutinizing everyone's actions and reactions.",
        "Benjamin: You're right, Victoria, I was preoccupied yesterday, but it was because of the werewolf situation causing me anxiety.  Sophia, you've been relatively quiet about your own actions and experiences. Can you share any details about your behavior last night or anything you noticed? Let's keep examining and discussing all our actions to make an informed decision.",
        "Sophia:  I understand your concerns, Benjamin. Last night, I stayed inside my house, trying to keep calm despite the frightening situation. I was too worried to observe anything suspicious, but now I realize that we must all be more vigilant. Let's continue discussing and observing everyone's behavior to uncover the werewolf. Emily, do you have any suggestions on how we could better assess each other's actions?",
        "Emily:  I think we should pay attention to people's reactions when they're questioned or accused. The werewolf might show signs of nervousness or attempt to shift the blame onto someone else. Let's also consider if anyone has motives for wanting to eliminate a fellow villager. Keep the conversations going, and remember to stay alert and focused.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [Bob was killed last night. I need to throw suspicion away from Benjamin and myself. Let's target Emily or Sophia.] \n\nI'm shocked about what happened to Bob! He was a good man. I overheard a strange noise coming from Emily's direction last night. Did anyone else notice that?",
        "Emily: [Thomas seems suspicious, but I need to be careful with my words.] I'm devastated about Bob. That's terrible, Thomas, but I must admit, I didn't hear anything. Could this be paranoia setting in? Surely we have to look for more concrete evidence.",

[I need to shift the suspicion away from Thomas and me.] While it's possible that Emily was involved, I also think we should consider other possibilities. Sophia, Victoria, what do you have to say about last night? Did you see or hear anything unusual?",
        "Sophia: [Although I didn't hear anything unusual, I should be careful and play smart.] I'm saddened by the loss of Bob, truly a tragedy. I didn't hear anything suspicious last night either, but it's vital we examine everyone's behavior and alibis. Victoria, do you have anything to add to this?",
        "Victoria: [What a devastating loss. I need to think about what I observed and what should I say] Bob's death is truly heartbreaking. I didn't hear anything unusual last night, but I did notice Thomas seemed quite restless earlier. We need to keep our eyes and ears open, and work together as a village to find the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: [Victoria is suspicious of me. I must redirect the focus to someone else.]\n\nIt's understandable that everyone is on edge, but I assure you, I was just anxious about the werewolf threat. We all must be cautious. Emily, I apologize if I jumped to conclusions, but we cannot ignore the possibility. Sophia, do you have any thoughts on who might be suspicious?",
        "Sophia: [Thomas seems apologetic, but I shouldn't disregard the possibility of him being the werewolf. I need to be careful.] No need to apologize, Thomas, we're all concerned about our safety.

It's important that we continue to communicate and watch each other closely to identify any irregularities. Let's be vigilant and work together to find the werewolf.",

Meanwhile, Emily, since you don't have any solid suspicions, what criteria do you think we should use to evaluate each other? Perhaps there's something we're overlooking.",
        "Victoria: [Benjamin is right, I should clarify my observation about Thomas.] Thomas was pacing back and forth outside his house, which could be just a result of anxiety given the situation. As for evaluating each other, I agree with Emily and Sophia. We should watch for any unusual behavior and inconsistencies in our testimonies. Let's be alert and keep discussing our observations to find the werewolf.",

As for my pacing, I couldn't sleep due to the werewolf threat. Emily, Victoria, and Sophia have made valid points about being observant. Victoria, did you notice anything about anyone else's behavior that could be suspicious?",
        "Victoria: [Hmm, what else did I notice?] While I didn't see anything explicitly suspicious last night, I did notice that Benjamin seemed quite preoccupied during the day. However, given the circumstances, this could be just another case of nerves.

Let's continue discussing and observing everyone's behavior to uncover the werewolf. Emily, do you have any suggestions on how we could better assess each other's actions?",
        "Emily: [Sophia's response seems reasonable, but we need to be proactive.] I think we should pay attention to people's reactions when they're questioned or accused. The werewolf might show signs of nervousness or attempt to shift the blame onto someone else. Let's also consider if anyone has motives for wanting to eliminate a fellow villager. Keep the conversations going, and remember to stay alert and focused.",
        "Thomas: [Emily's suggestion to watch for reactions and motives is a good one. I need to cast suspicion away from Benjamin and myself. Sophia is the least suspicious, so accusing her might raise suspicions against me. However, Emily and Victoria both mentioned observing behavior, so I'll choose between them.]\n\nI vote for Victoria.",
        "Emily: [Thomas voted for Victoria, but I'm not quite convinced. Victoria pointed out Thomas's restlessness, and he was the first to cast suspicion on me. Benjamin was preoccupied, and Sophia was quiet about her own actions but seems reasonable. I have to make a choice.]\nI vote for Thomas.",
        "Benjamin: [I need to protect Thomas and shift suspicion elsewhere.] I vote for Emily.",
