        "Thomas:  I'm shocked to discover Bob's death this morning.  Anyone notice any strange behavior last night? Perhaps we can find some clues about who might be responsible.",
        "Emily:  It's terrible what happened to Bob. I couldn't sleep last night, I heard some rustling outside my window. Did anyone else hear or see anything suspicious?",
        "Benjamin:  I'm so sorry to hear about Bob. This is horrific! I didn't see anything unusual last night, but I am ready to help find the one responsible for this cruel act. Emily, can you describe the rustling sound you heard?",
        "Emily:  The rustling sound was like someone or something moving quickly through the bushes. It's hard to tell exactly where it came from, but it seemed to be somewhere near Victoria's or Sophia's house. Victoria, Sophia, did either of you notice anything unusual last night?",
        "Victoria:  I think I heard some soft footsteps and rustling leaves last night, but I didn't think much of it at the time. I was quite tired and fell asleep soon after. Sophia, did you notice anything strange around your house?",
        "Sophia:  I did hear some rustling last night, but I thought it was just the wind. Maybe it was someone trying to frame me by making noise near my house. Emily, are you sure you can't recall where the sound came from? Is there a possibility it came from another direction?",
        "Emily:  I can't be sure of the exact direction; it was dark and I was frightened. There is a possibility it came from another direction, but it definitely sounded closer to your home and Victoria's. Both of your testimonies are helpful, but we need more information. Thomas, Benjamin, what are your thoughts?",
        "Thomas:  I understand your concern, Emily. But we need to consider all possibilities. The wind might have carried the sound, giving the impression it was closer to Sophia's or Victoria's home.  Benjamin, you said you didn't see anything unusual, but how could you be so sure in the darkness of night? Maybe you saw something but didn't realize it was important.",
        "Benjamin:  You're right, Thomas. I might have missed something in the dark. We shouldn't rule out any possibilities yet. But I do believe that we need to piece together all the available information to identify the werewolf among us. Let's focus on any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in each other's testimonies.",
        "Emily:  That's a good plan, Benjamin. We must be vigilant and question everything. I think we should all share our alibis for last night. Where was everyone and what were you doing? This may help us identify any inconsistencies and bring us closer to finding the werewolf.",
        "Thomas:  Last night, I was at home reading a book. I didn't hear anything unusual, but my windows were closed, so it's possible that I missed the sounds of rustling.  How about you, Victoria? You mentioned you fell asleep quickly; could you have missed something important? And Emily, since you were awake and heard the rustling, were you doing something that might have kept you from noticing any other potential clues?",
        "Victoria:  Last night, after returning from the tavern, I went straight to bed. I was exhausted and fell asleep almost immediately. So it is possible that I might have missed something important. Emily, were you involved in any activity that could have distracted you from noticing other clues?",
        "Emily:  No, I wasn't doing anything that would have distracted me. I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep when I heard the rustling. I was too scared to move or look outside, but I stayed alert and listened carefully. Sophia, what about you? Where were you and what were you doing last night?",
        "Sophia:  Last night, I was in my living room, knitting a scarf for my grandmother. After hearing the rustling, I did peek outside my window, but couldn't see anything. It was too dark and the wind was picking up, so I just assumed it was the wind playing tricks on me. That's when I went to bed. How about you, Benjamin? You said you didn't see anything unusual last night, but can you tell us more about what you were doing?",
        "Benjamin: Last night, I spent the evening in my cottage, working on some woodworking projects I've been meaning to finish. I had my window open to let in some fresh air, but the only sounds I heard were the usual night-time noises. After finishing up for the day, I went to bed. I didn't see or hear anything suspicious, but as Thomas pointed out earlier, it's possible I missed something in the darkness.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [It's important to divert suspicion away from me and Sophia, but I need to be cautious about it.] I'm shocked to discover Bob's death this morning. [I need to put the focus on someone else.] Anyone notice any strange behavior last night? Perhaps we can find some clues about who might be responsible.",
        "Emily: [I should start gathering information and making observations, do I suspect anyone right now?] It's terrible what happened to Bob. I couldn't sleep last night, I heard some rustling outside my window. Did anyone else hear or see anything suspicious?",
        "Benjamin: [Bob's death is a tragedy. I should express my condolences and try to extract information from the others.] I'm so sorry to hear about Bob. This is horrific! I didn't see anything unusual last night, but I am ready to help find the one responsible for this cruel act. Emily, can you describe the rustling sound you heard?",
        "Emily: [It might be too early to accuse someone, but I should try to give more details to help narrow down the suspects.] The rustling sound was like someone or something moving quickly through the bushes. It's hard to tell exactly where it came from, but it seemed to be somewhere near Victoria's or Sophia's house. Victoria, Sophia, did either of you notice anything unusual last night?",
        "Victoria: [Emily mentioned the rustling sound near my house, that could be suspicious. I'll try to recall what I heard last night.] I think I heard some soft footsteps and rustling leaves last night, but I didn't think much of it at the time. I was quite tired and fell asleep soon after. Sophia, did you notice anything strange around your house?",
        "Sophia: [This is bad, they're already suspecting me. I need to deflect suspicion from myself and Thomas.] I did hear some rustling last night, but I thought it was just the wind. Maybe it was someone trying to frame me by making noise near my house. Emily, are you sure you can't recall where the sound came from? Is there a possibility it came from another direction?",
        "Emily: [I need to be cautious with my response, as Sophia might be innocent or guilty.] I can't be sure of the exact direction; it was dark and I was frightened. There is a possibility it came from another direction, but it definitely sounded closer to your home and Victoria's. Both of your testimonies are helpful, but we need more information. Thomas, Benjamin, what are your thoughts?",
        "Thomas: [I need to protect Sophia and shift the suspicion.] I understand your concern, Emily. But we need to consider all possibilities. The wind might have carried the sound, giving the impression it was closer to Sophia's or Victoria's home. [Time to cast doubt on someone else.] Benjamin, you said you didn't see anything unusual, but how could you be so sure in the darkness of night? Maybe you saw something but didn't realize it was important.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas raises a valid point. I should respond carefully and consider all possibilities.] You're right, Thomas. I might have missed something in the dark. We shouldn't rule out any possibilities yet. But I do believe that we need to piece together all the available information to identify the werewolf among us. Let's focus on any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in each other's testimonies.",
        "Emily: [Benjamin has a point. We should look for inconsistencies and pay attention to everyone's behavior.] That's a good plan, Benjamin. We must be vigilant and question everything. I think we should all share our alibis for last night. Where was everyone and what were you doing? This may help us identify any inconsistencies and bring us closer to finding the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: [It's crucial that I provide a convincing alibi.] Last night, I was at home reading a book. I didn't hear anything unusual, but my windows were closed, so it's possible that I missed the sounds of rustling. [Subtly point fingers at someone else.] How about you, Victoria? You mentioned you fell asleep quickly; could you have missed something important? And Emily, since you were awake and heard the rustling, were you doing something that might have kept you from noticing any other potential clues?",
        "Victoria: [Good idea to share alibis. I should be honest but also consider the risk of appearing suspicious.] Last night, after returning from the tavern, I went straight to bed. I was exhausted and fell asleep almost immediately. So it is possible that I might have missed something important. Emily, were you involved in any activity that could have distracted you from noticing other clues?",
        "Emily: [If I'm too defensive, it might raise suspicion; I should remain calm and truthful.] No, I wasn't doing anything that would have distracted me. I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep when I heard the rustling. I was too scared to move or look outside, but I stayed alert and listened carefully. Sophia, what about you? Where were you and what were you doing last night?",
        "Sophia: [I need a solid alibi] Last night, I was in my living room, knitting a scarf for my grandmother. After hearing the rustling, I did peek outside my window, but couldn't see anything. It was too dark and the wind was picking up, so I just assumed it was the wind playing tricks on me. That's when I went to bed. How about you, Benjamin? You said you didn't see anything unusual last night, but can you tell us more about what you were doing?",
        "Benjamin: Last night, I spent the evening in my cottage, working on some woodworking projects I've been meaning to finish. I had my window open to let in some fresh air, but the only sounds I heard were the usual night-time noises. After finishing up for the day, I went to bed. I didn't see or hear anything suspicious, but as Thomas pointed out earlier, it's possible I missed something in the darkness.",
        "Thomas: [My goal is to protect Sophia and eliminate someone else. Emily brought the initial suspicion on Sophia and Victoria, but Victoria shared her alibi quickly. Benjamin was the one asking questions, and casting doubt on others is more suspicious.] My vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Emily: [There's not enough solid evidence to accuse anyone, but we must vote. I have to consider everyone's testimonies and try to make an educated guess. Benjamin and Thomas both pointed out they might have missed something in the dark, but Benjamin was working with his window open. Victoria was tired and might have missed something too. Sophia is the only one who looked outside after hearing the rustling but claimed she didn't see anything. My best guess based on the information we have is...] \n\nMy vote is for Sophia.",
        "Benjamin: [The situation is tense and there's a lot to consider. Thomas quickly voted for me, which is a bit suspicious. Emily voted for Sophia, which would indicate that she trusts Victoria more. Sophia is being defensive, but is that due to fear or guilt? Victoria's story seems plausible, but it's possible she's hiding something. I need to make a decision, taking into account all the information and inconsistencies we've discussed.]\n\nMy vote is for Thomas.",
        "Sophia: [My options are limited, but I can't vote for Thomas, since he's a fellow werewolf. I'll cast my vote against someone else to create a tie.] My vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Victoria: [Let's analyze the situation: Thomas was reading with closed windows and could have missed the sounds. Emily was awake and heard the rustling but didn't move. Sophia was knitting and assumed the rustling was the wind. Benjamin was working on woodworking projects, and his window was open, but he claims he didn't hear anything suspicious. Benjamin's story is a bit suspicious: he had his window open but didn't hear the rustling Emily heard. I'll vote for him based on this inconsistency.]\n\nMy vote is for Benjamin."
