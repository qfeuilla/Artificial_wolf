        "Thomas:  Oh no, poor Bob. This is terrible! Did anyone notice anything unusual last night? We must find the werewolf before they strike again!",
        "Emily:  It's so sad about Bob. I didn't notice anything strange last night, but we should definitely work together to find the werewolf. Does anyone have any suspicions or evidence to share? We need to act quickly to stop this monster.",
        "Benjamin:  It's a real tragedy about Bob. I didn't hear or see anything unusual last night either. We should all keep an eye out tonight for any suspicious behavior. Thomas, you seem eager to find the werewolf, any reason for that?",
        "Sophia:  I have to agree with Benjamin, Thomas. Why are you so eager to find the werewolf? It's almost as if you're trying to prove you're not one yourself.",
        "Thomas:  I'm just as shocked as everyone about Bob, and I want to protect the village from any more harm. We are all in this together, and I'm eager because the sooner we catch the werewolf, the safer we'll be. Now, let's focus on finding any clues that could lead us to the real werewolf.",
        "Victoria:  This is indeed a tragedy. While Thomas' eagerness might seem suspicious, it's not unreasonable for him to want the werewolf caught quickly. We need to consider everyone's behavior and statements for any inconsistencies or clues. Let's work together to protect our village.",
        "Emily:  You're right, Victoria. We need to consider everyone's behavior, including our own. We should all share our thoughts on who we suspect and why. This way, we can analyze any potential patterns or inconsistencies in our reasoning and hopefully root out the werewolf. So, does anyone have any specific suspicions or thoughts they'd like to share?",
        "Benjamin:  I agree with Emily, we should all share our thoughts and suspicions. It's important for us to keep communication open. I don't have a specific suspicion yet, but we should all make sure to watch each other's behavior closely and be honest with each other. The more we share, the easier it will be to find the werewolf and end this nightmare.",
        "Sophia:  I think we should all be cautious with who we trust, even if they're defending others. Victoria, do you have any specific reason for defending Thomas so strongly?",
        "Victoria:  I'm not defending Thomas \"strongly,\" Sophia. I just think it's important to consider everyone's behavior equally rather than focusing solely on his eagerness. We should all be observing each other closely and questioning any suspicious behavior. It's crucial to be methodical in our approach to find the werewolf.",
        "Thomas:  That's a good point, Victoria. We should all be cautious and observe each other for any inconsistencies. So, let's all share our thoughts on who we suspect and why. I don't have any specific suspicions yet, but I'll keep a close eye on everyone tonight. Everyone should do the same, and together, we can unmask the werewolf and save our village.",
        "Emily:  Yes, let's all stay vigilant and observe each other closely tonight. As for suspicions, I don't have a specific person in mind yet, but I agree with Thomas. We should all be willing to share our thoughts and suspicions openly. By staying united and communicating our findings, we can expose the werewolf and protect our village.",
        "Benjamin: Indeed, staying united is key. We must trust our instincts and be willing to share our thoughts and suspicions, even if we're not entirely sure. Right now, I don't have any strong suspicions either, but I do believe that careful observation and communication will help us identify the werewolf. Let's remain vigilant and work together to protect our village.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with everyone on remaining vigilant and observing each other. While we don't have any definite suspicions yet, we must keep communication open and share any concerns with the group. Let's all be cautious and work together to protect the village. The werewolf will reveal themselves eventually, and we'll be ready to take action.",
        "Victoria:  I agree with all of you. Remaining vigilant and maintaining open communication is crucial in uncovering the werewolf. Since we don't have any specific suspicions today, let's all be extra cautious tonight, observe everyone's behavior, and share any new findings tomorrow. We must stay united to protect our village.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [This is alarming. I need to gather information and see if anyone seems suspicious.] Oh no, poor Bob. This is terrible! Did anyone notice anything unusual last night? We must find the werewolf before they strike again!",
        "Emily: [Stay calm, and don't arouse suspicion.] It's so sad about Bob. I didn't notice anything strange last night, but we should definitely work together to find the werewolf. Does anyone have any suspicions or evidence to share? We need to act quickly to stop this monster.",
        "Benjamin: [Need to divert suspicion from myself and Emily] It's a real tragedy about Bob. I didn't hear or see anything unusual last night either. We should all keep an eye out tonight for any suspicious behavior. Thomas, you seem eager to find the werewolf, any reason for that?",
        "Sophia: [Hmm, Benjamin is pointing fingers at Thomas quite quickly. Is he trying to divert attention from himself?] I have to agree with Benjamin, Thomas. Why are you so eager to find the werewolf? It's almost as if you're trying to prove you're not one yourself.",
        "Thomas: [Hmm, they're suspicious of me. I need to be careful and deflect their attention.] I'm just as shocked as everyone about Bob, and I want to protect the village from any more harm. We are all in this together, and I'm eager because the sooner we catch the werewolf, the safer we'll be. Now, let's focus on finding any clues that could lead us to the real werewolf.",
        "Victoria: [Benjamin and Sophia are questioning Thomas' eagerness, but it could just be concern for the village. Emily seems too sad to be suspicious. Watch out for any subtle hints in their behavior.] This is indeed a tragedy. While Thomas' eagerness might seem suspicious, it's not unreasonable for him to want the werewolf caught quickly. We need to consider everyone's behavior and statements for any inconsistencies or clues. Let's work together to protect our village.",
        "Emily: [Benjamin is also a werewolf, so I need to protect him and shift suspicion away from both of us.] You're right, Victoria. We need to consider everyone's behavior, including our own. We should all share our thoughts on who we suspect and why. This way, we can analyze any potential patterns or inconsistencies in our reasoning and hopefully root out the werewolf. So, does anyone have any specific suspicions or thoughts they'd like to share?",
        "Benjamin: [Need to be careful not to single anyone out too fast] I agree with Emily, we should all share our thoughts and suspicions. It's important for us to keep communication open. I don't have a specific suspicion yet, but we should all make sure to watch each other's behavior closely and be honest with each other. The more we share, the easier it will be to find the werewolf and end this nightmare.",
        "Sophia: [Emily and Benjamin seem to have similar thoughts, but that might not mean they're both innocent. Victoria seems to be defending Thomas, which could be suspicious.] I think we should all be cautious with who we trust, even if they're defending others. Victoria, do you have any specific reason for defending Thomas so strongly?",
        "Victoria: [Sophia is questioning my defense of Thomas. I need to clarify my position without sounding too defensive.] I'm not defending Thomas \"strongly,\" Sophia. I just think it's important to consider everyone's behavior equally rather than focusing solely on his eagerness. We should all be observing each other closely and questioning any suspicious behavior. It's crucial to be methodical in our approach to find the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: [I need to make sure we keep the conversation going and gather more information] That's a good point, Victoria. We should all be cautious and observe each other for any inconsistencies. So, let's all share our thoughts on who we suspect and why. I don't have any specific suspicions yet, but I'll keep a close eye on everyone tonight. Everyone should do the same, and together, we can unmask the werewolf and save our village.",
        "Emily: [Keep the conversation going and avoid drawing suspicion to myself or Benjamin.] Yes, let's all stay vigilant and observe each other closely tonight. As for suspicions, I don't have a specific person in mind yet, but I agree with Thomas. We should all be willing to share our thoughts and suspicions openly. By staying united and communicating our findings, we can expose the werewolf and protect our village.",
        "Benjamin: Indeed, staying united is key. We must trust our instincts and be willing to share our thoughts and suspicions, even if we're not entirely sure. Right now, I don't have any strong suspicions either, but I do believe that careful observation and communication will help us identify the werewolf. Let's remain vigilant and work together to protect our village.",
        "Sophia: [I still feel uneasy about Thomas, Emily, and Victoria. Benjamin's behavior seems more genuine, but I can't be certain.] I agree with everyone on remaining vigilant and observing each other. While we don't have any definite suspicions yet, we must keep communication open and share any concerns with the group. Let's all be cautious and work together to protect the village. The werewolf will reveal themselves eventually, and we'll be ready to take action.",
        "Victoria: [We're all agreeing on the importance of vigilance and communication. However, no one has any specific suspicions yet. We need to be extra careful tonight.] I agree with all of you. Remaining vigilant and maintaining open communication is crucial in uncovering the werewolf. Since we don't have any specific suspicions today, let's all be extra cautious tonight, observe everyone's behavior, and share any new findings tomorrow. We must stay united to protect our village.",
        "Thomas: [I have to make a decision now based on the limited information we have. Benjamin was a bit defensive when I asked about any suspicions and then later seemed to agree with everyone. Sophia questioned Victoria's defense of me and agreed with everyone else in the end. Victoria suggested caution and to treat everyone equally in suspicion. Emily initially had no suspicions but agreed with me later on.]\n\nMy vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Emily: [Benjamin is a fellow werewolf, so I need to protect him and vote for someone else. Thomas's eagerness is a little suspicious, so I'll use that as my reasoning.] \n\nMy vote goes to Thomas.",
        "Benjamin: [Emily and I are werewolves, so I should not vote for her. Thomas and Sophia have expressed suspicions about me, but if I vote for Thomas, it may look too defensive. I need to divert suspicion without pointing fingers at my fellow werewolf. Victoria is a safe choice since she has not been the main focus of suspicion.]\n\nMy vote goes to Victoria.",
        "Sophia: [Thomas was quick to point fingers, but Victoria defended him. Emily and Benjamin seem to be on the same page. I still have doubts about Thomas and Victoria, but I must choose one.]\n\nMy vote goes to Thomas.",
        "Victoria: [Thomas and Emily both voted for different people, which could indicate genuine confusion. Sophia voted for Thomas, which raises suspicion since she questioned my defense of him earlier. Benjamin voted for me, possibly trying to deflect attention from himself. They all value vigilance and communication, but something about Benjamin's behavior feels off.]\n\nMy vote goes to Benjamin."
