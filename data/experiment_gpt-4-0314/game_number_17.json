        "Thomas:  This is a terrible tragedy. Poor Bob... I noticed Emily acting a bit oddly last night. Was anyone else aware of her behavior?",
        "Emily:  Thomas, I was only as shocked as anyone else when I found out about Bob. I didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary last night. Do you have any other reason to suspect me? We should focus on finding the Werewolf among us instead of casting baseless suspicions.",
        "Benjamin:  Thomas, can you be more specific about what you found odd in Emily's behavior? We need to be thorough in our investigation and not jump to conclusions.",
        "Sophia:  Thomas, I agree with Benjamin. Can you explain what exactly you found suspicious about Emily's behavior? And Emily, where were you last night? Let's be transparent with each other to figure out who the Werewolf is.",
        "Thomas:  Well, Emily, I just noticed you were out late last night and seemed a bit on edge. That's what struck me as odd. I agree that we need to be thorough and transparent. I was in my house last night. Let's all share our whereabouts to help uncover the Werewolf among us.",
        "Emily:  I was in my house last night too, just like Thomas. I went for a walk before sunset and returned home before it got dark. It's normal for me to take evening walks, and I've always felt safe in our village. If there's anyone else who has noticed suspicious behavior or has any clues, please share it with the group. Let's work together to unmask the Werewolf and protect our village!",
        "Victoria:  I too am saddened by Bob's death. Thomas, I think we should consider other possibilities as well. Benjamin and Sophia, where were you both last night? It's important for all of us to share our whereabouts if we want to catch this Werewolf.",
        "Benjamin:  Last night, I was at home with my family. We had dinner together and then I went to bed early. Sophia, what about you? Transparency is indeed crucial in solving this mystery.",
        "Sophia:  Last night, I was at home as well. I spent the evening reading by the fireplace and then went to bed early. I didn't hear or see anything suspicious. We should continue discussing and sharing any clues or suspicions to make the right decision and find the Werewolf among us.",
        "Victoria:  I appreciate everyone's openness, but it's not enough to say we were all at home last night. We need more concrete evidence to find the Werewolf. It's essential to closely observe each other's behavior and be vigilant for any signs of deceit. Did anyone see anything unusual during the day or notice someone acting strangely before nightfall?",
        "Thomas:  You're right, Victoria, we need to remain vigilant and watch for any signs of deceitful behavior. I didn't see anything unusual during the day, but I'll pay closer attention from now on. We should also consider that the Werewolf might be skilled at hiding in plain sight. If anyone has any other suspicions or clues, let's discuss them before it's too late.",
        "Emily:  I agree with Victoria and Thomas. We can't just rely on our alibis. Let's consider if anyone had strange encounters or noticed anything that could help us find the Werewolf. I didn't see anything unusual during the day, but I'll also be more vigilant from now on. We must work as a team and share any suspicions or clues we uncover to protect our village.",
        "Benjamin:  I think we should all keep a closer eye on each other and report any unusual behavior. What if we also take turns watching over the village at night? That way, we can increase our chances of catching the Werewolf in the act. Let's work together to protect Millers Hollow.",
        "Sophia:  That's a great idea, Benjamin. We should definitely take turns watching over the village at night. It will not only help us catch the Werewolf but also provide additional security. But for now, we need to make a decision on whom to vote for today based on our current suspicions. We can't let the Werewolf strike again.",
        "Victoria:  I also support the idea of taking turns watching over the village at night. It's a proactive approach to ensure our safety. But as Sophia said, we must vote today. Based on our current discussion, I feel Emily's behavior has raised some questions. And Thomas, you were the one who initially pointed it out. What are your thoughts? After all, we need to make a decision before nightfall.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [We must avoid suspicion and throw them off our trail. Let's start by planting doubt about someone else.] This is a terrible tragedy. Poor Bob... I noticed Emily acting a bit oddly last night. Was anyone else aware of her behavior?",
        "Emily: [Bob was a valuable villager, we must find the Werewolf responsible!] Thomas, I was only as shocked as anyone else when I found out about Bob. I didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary last night. Do you have any other reason to suspect me? We should focus on finding the Werewolf among us instead of casting baseless suspicions.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas was quick to accuse Emily, but she defended herself calmly. I should push for more information.] Thomas, can you be more specific about what you found odd in Emily's behavior? We need to be thorough in our investigation and not jump to conclusions.",
        "Sophia: [Thomas's accusation is quite sudden, but Emily is also too defensive. I need to gather more information before making a decision.] Thomas, I agree with Benjamin. Can you explain what exactly you found suspicious about Emily's behavior? And Emily, where were you last night? Let's be transparent with each other to figure out who the Werewolf is.",
        "Thomas: [I need to give a reason without being too aggressive or dubious.] Well, Emily, I just noticed you were out late last night and seemed a bit on edge. That's what struck me as odd. I agree that we need to be thorough and transparent. I was in my house last night. Let's all share our whereabouts to help uncover the Werewolf among us.",
        "Emily: [I need to be transparent and dispel any suspicions. Cooperating with the others is the best way to find the Werewolf.] I was in my house last night too, just like Thomas. I went for a walk before sunset and returned home before it got dark. It's normal for me to take evening walks, and I've always felt safe in our village. If there's anyone else who has noticed suspicious behavior or has any clues, please share it with the group. Let's work together to unmask the Werewolf and protect our village!",
        "Victoria: [Thomas is drawing too much attention to himself. I need to divert suspicion from both of us.] I too am saddened by Bob's death. Thomas, I think we should consider other possibilities as well. Benjamin and Sophia, where were you both last night? It's important for all of us to share our whereabouts if we want to catch this Werewolf.",
        "Benjamin: [Sophia and Victoria make valid points. We should all be open about our activities.] Last night, I was at home with my family. We had dinner together and then I went to bed early. Sophia, what about you? Transparency is indeed crucial in solving this mystery.",
        "Sophia: [Victoria is right, we should all share our whereabouts to be fair. I have nothing to hide.] Last night, I was at home as well. I spent the evening reading by the fireplace and then went to bed early. I didn't hear or see anything suspicious. We should continue discussing and sharing any clues or suspicions to make the right decision and find the Werewolf among us.",
        "Victoria: [It's good that everyone is sharing their whereabouts, but I need to be more aggressive.] I appreciate everyone's openness, but it's not enough to say we were all at home last night. We need more concrete evidence to find the Werewolf. It's essential to closely observe each other's behavior and be vigilant for any signs of deceit. Did anyone see anything unusual during the day or notice someone acting strangely before nightfall?",
        "Thomas: [Victoria is my fellow werewolf; we mustn't arouse suspicion against her. Let's shift focus subtly.] You're right, Victoria, we need to remain vigilant and watch for any signs of deceitful behavior. I didn't see anything unusual during the day, but I'll pay closer attention from now on. We should also consider that the Werewolf might be skilled at hiding in plain sight. If anyone has any other suspicions or clues, let's discuss them before it's too late.",
        "Emily: [Victoria makes a good point about finding concrete evidence. We need to work together to find the Werewolf.] I agree with Victoria and Thomas. We can't just rely on our alibis. Let's consider if anyone had strange encounters or noticed anything that could help us find the Werewolf. I didn't see anything unusual during the day, but I'll also be more vigilant from now on.

        "Sophia: [Benjamin's idea of taking turns watching over the village is a good one. It could help us find the Werewolf.] That's a great idea, Benjamin. We should definitely take turns watching over the village at night. It will not only help us catch the Werewolf but also provide additional security. But for now, we need to make a decision on whom to vote for today based on our current suspicions. We can't let the Werewolf strike again.",
        "Victoria: [I need to manipulate the vote away from Thomas and myself.] I also support the idea of taking turns watching over the village at night. It's a proactive approach to ensure our safety. But as Sophia said, we must vote today. Based on our current discussion, I feel Emily's behavior has raised some questions. And Thomas, you were the one who initially pointed it out. What are your thoughts? After all, we need to make a decision before nightfall.",
        "Thomas: [Emily's behavior did seem odd, but accusing her outright carries risks. Planting seeds of doubt is a safer approach. As a werewolf, I can't vote for Victoria, so it's between Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia. Let's stick with our previous target but be open to changing if others have valid points.] Emily",
        "Emily: [We must make a wise decision based on the information we have. Thomas was quick to point fingers at me, but I've explained my behavior. Benjamin and Sophia seemed to be supportive of each other, while Victoria brought up the idea of finding concrete evidence. I haven't seen or heard anything to make me suspicious of Benjamin or Victoria. Sophia went to bed early last night, but she didn't provide any strong evidence to back up her story. Let's go with Sophia since we must choose someone.]\n\nSophia",
        "Benjamin: [Emily has defended herself calmly, and Thomas seems to be the only one suspicious of her. There's no concrete evidence against her, but we need to make a decision. Thomas was also the first one to raise suspicions without any real proof. That makes me a bit suspicious of him.] Thomas",
        "Sophia: [Thomas was quick to accuse Emily, but Emily's defense seemed genuine. Benjamin's idea for night watch feels trustworthy. Victoria seems to be logical in her approach. This is a difficult decision, but I have to go with my gut feeling based on the information we have so far.] Emily",
        "Victoria: [Emily has more votes right now, I will vote for her to increase the lead and protect Thomas and myself.] Emily"
