        "Thomas: \n\nThis is devastating, poor Bob. We need to work together to figure out who the Werewolf is before it's too late. Let's all share our thoughts and suspicions. Does anyone have any leads or witnessed anything unusual?",
        "Emily:  It's terrible that we lost Bob. I don't have any concrete suspicions yet, but I think it's crucial to listen carefully to everyone and look for inconsistencies in their stories or suspicious behavior. We can't afford to make mistakes.",
        "Benjamin:  I agree with both of you. We need to stay united and vigilant. I didn't witness anything unusual last night, but we should all keep our eyes and ears open. Let's be cautious with our accusations as well; we don't want to eliminate an innocent villager by mistake.",
        "Sophia:  It's a tragedy losing Bob. I also didn't see anything suspicious last night, but we should pay attention to how others act and what they say. It's possible the Werewolf is hiding in plain sight, trying to blend in with us. Be on your guard, everyone.",
        "Victoria:  I agree with everyone's sentiments so far. It's essential to be vigilant and observant, especially for any unusual behavior or statements. Remember, the Werewolf will try to blend in and cast suspicion on others, so stay sharp, and don't let emotion cloud your judgment.",
        "Thomas: \n\nI appreciate everyone's vigilance so far, but I feel like we're just stating the obvious. Let's try to get more specific. For example, has anyone noticed any strange behavior from someone in the group or something that doesn't quite add up? We need to dig deeper if we want to find the Werewolf.",
        "Emily:  You're right, Thomas. Just agreeing on vigilance won't get us anywhere. I've noticed that Benjamin has been a bit too quiet and seemingly agreeable. Benjamin, can you tell us more about what you were doing last night and if you noticed anything unusual?",
        "Benjamin:  Of course, Emily. I didn't mean to appear too quiet; I was just observing the conversation. Last night, I was at home, and honestly, I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary. However, I do think it's essential for us to keep discussing and sharing our thoughts. Maybe someone else has some useful information or has noticed something important.",
        "Sophia:  I understand your concern, Emily, but maybe we should dig deeper on all of us. Thomas, you've been leading the conversation and trying to direct our focus. Can you tell us more about what you were doing last night and if you saw or heard anything unusual? It's crucial that we examine everyone's actions and statements.",
        "Thomas: \n\nSophia, I appreciate your scrutiny. Last night, I was at home as well. I didn't see or hear anything unusual, but I've been trying to stay proactive in this discussion to help us find the Werewolf before they strike again. I agree with your point \u2013 it's essential to examine everyone's actions and statements, and I encourage others to share more information about their whereabouts and any observations they've made.",
        "Victoria:  Okay, let's try to get more specific, as Thomas suggested. I was at home last night too, and I didn't notice anything unusual. However, I want to point out that Emily was quick to raise suspicion on Benjamin without any substantial reason. Emily, do you have any particular reason to be suspicious of Benjamin? Is there anything else you'd like to share about last night or your thoughts on the situation?",
        "Emily:  I understand your concern, Victoria. I didn't mean to imply that Benjamin is the Werewolf without concrete evidence. I just wanted to encourage more active discussion and thought his quietness might be worth exploring. As for my last night, I was at home and didn't notice anything unusual either. My main focus now is to analyze everyone's behavior, and I encourage everyone to ask questions and share their thoughts and observations. Together, we can uncover the truth and protect our village.",
        "Benjamin:  Thank you for clearing that up, Emily. We all need to work together and question each other to find the Werewolf. I have a question for Sophia: you were quick to point out Thomas as someone worth scrutinizing, do you have any particular reason for this or anything to share about your own activities last night? The more information we can gather, the better our chances of identifying the Werewolf.",
        "Sophia: Benjamin, I appreciate the question. I just wanted to ensure that we're all being thorough in our investigation, including questioning those who are leading the conversation. As for my activities last night, I was at home, and unfortunately, I didn't notice anything unusual either. My aim is to analyze everyone's behavior and words carefully to help identify the Werewolf. We must stay united and keep sharing our thoughts and observations in order to protect our village.",
        "Victoria:  I appreciate everyone's willingness to ask questions and share information. As we continue this discussion, let's not forget to consider small details or unusual behavior. We must stay focused and observant if we want to protect our village. Does anyone have any new thoughts or observations about the current situation or possible leads on the Werewolf's identity? Remember, every piece of information, no matter how small, could be crucial.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [This is a terrible tragedy, but I need to focus. Who among us could be the Werewolf? I should encourage everyone to share their thoughts and see if I can catch any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.]\n\nThis is devastating, poor Bob. We need to work together to figure out who the Werewolf is before it's too late. Let's all share our thoughts and suspicions. Does anyone have any leads or witnessed anything unusual?",
        "Emily: [Bob's death is tragic, and I need to start analyzing people's behavior. Thomas seems to be cooperative, which is a good sign.] It's terrible that we lost Bob. I don't have any concrete suspicions yet, but I think it's crucial to listen carefully to everyone and look for inconsistencies in their stories or suspicious behavior. We can't afford to make mistakes.",
        "Benjamin: [As a werewolf, I need to blend in and not raise suspicion.] I agree with both of you. We need to stay united and vigilant. I didn't witness anything unusual last night, but we should all keep our eyes and ears open. Let's be cautious with our accusations as well; we don't want to eliminate an innocent villager by mistake.",
        "Sophia: [Don't be too aggressive yet, but start casting doubt on the others] It's a tragedy losing Bob. I also didn't see anything suspicious last night, but we should pay attention to how others act and what they say. It's possible the Werewolf is hiding in plain sight, trying to blend in with us. Be on your guard, everyone.",
        "Victoria: [Bob's death is tragic, but we must focus on finding the Werewolf. Thomas seems to be taking charge, while Emily and Benjamin are cautious. Sophia could be trying to seem innocent while also drawing suspicion away from herself.] I agree with everyone's sentiments so far. It's essential to be vigilant and observant, especially for any unusual behavior or statements. Remember, the Werewolf will try to blend in and cast suspicion on others, so stay sharp, and don't let emotion cloud your judgment.",
        "Thomas: [Interesting, everyone seems to be on the same page. But we need to dig deeper. Let's try to see if anyone is trying to avoid suspicion by being too agreeable.]\n\nI appreciate everyone's vigilance so far, but I feel like we're just stating the obvious. Let's try to get more specific. For example, has anyone noticed any strange behavior from someone in the group or something that doesn't quite add up?

        "Emily: [Thomas has a good point. We need to be more proactive in our investigation.] You're right, Thomas. Just agreeing on vigilance won't get us anywhere. I've noticed that Benjamin has been a bit too quiet and seemingly agreeable. Benjamin, can you tell us more about what you were doing last night and if you noticed anything unusual?",
        "Benjamin: [She's getting suspicious; I need to defend myself without drawing more attention.] Of course, Emily. I didn't mean to appear too quiet; I was just observing the conversation. Last night, I was at home, and honestly, I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary. However, I do think it's essential for us to keep discussing and sharing our thoughts. Maybe someone else has some useful information or has noticed something important.",
        "Sophia: [Time to redirect suspicion] I understand your concern, Emily, but maybe we should dig deeper on all of us. Thomas, you've been leading the conversation and trying to direct our focus. Can you tell us more about what you were doing last night and if you saw or heard anything unusual? It's crucial that we examine everyone's actions and statements.",
        "Thomas: [That's a fair question. I need to make sure my actions don't seem suspicious while also keeping the conversation productive.]\n\nSophia, I appreciate your scrutiny. Last night, I was at home as well. I didn't see or hear anything unusual, but I've been trying to stay proactive in this discussion to help us find the Werewolf before they strike again. I agree with your point \u2013 it's essential to examine everyone's actions and statements, and I encourage others to share more information about their whereabouts and any observations they've made.",
        "Victoria: [Thomas and Benjamin are trying to take charge, but that could also be a strategy to deflect suspicion. Emily is observant, while Sophia is making sure to scrutinize everyone, including Thomas.] Okay, let's try to get more specific, as Thomas suggested. I was at home last night too, and I didn't notice anything unusual. However, I want to point out that Emily was quick to raise suspicion on Benjamin without any substantial reason. Emily, do you have any particular reason to be suspicious of Benjamin? Is there anything else you'd like to share about last night or your thoughts on the situation?",
        "Emily: [Victoria has a point; I need to clarify my suspicions about Benjamin.] I understand your concern, Victoria. I didn't mean to imply that Benjamin is the Werewolf without concrete evidence. I just wanted to encourage more active discussion and thought his quietness might be worth exploring. As for my last night, I was at home and didn't notice anything unusual either. My main focus now is to analyze everyone's behavior, and I encourage everyone to ask questions and share their thoughts and observations. Together, we can uncover the truth and protect our village.",
        "Benjamin: [Now's my chance to shift focus away from myself.] Thank you for clearing that up, Emily. We all need to work together and question each other to find the Werewolf. I have a question for Sophia: you were quick to point out Thomas as someone worth scrutinizing, do you have any particular reason for this or anything to share about your own activities last night? The more information we can gather, the better our chances of identifying the Werewolf.",

We must stay united and keep sharing our thoughts and observations in order to protect our village.",
        "Victoria: [Emily and Benjamin's responses make sense, and Sophia's focus on scrutinizing everyone is reasonable. However, we still don't have any concrete leads to identify the Werewolf.] I appreciate everyone's willingness to ask questions and share information. As we continue this discussion, let's not forget to consider small details or unusual behavior. We must stay focused and observant if we want to protect our village. Does anyone have any new thoughts or observations about the current situation or possible leads on the Werewolf's identity? Remember, every piece of information, no matter how small, could be crucial.",
        "Thomas: [Let's recap the information we've gathered so far. Everyone claims to have been at home last night, and no one reported witnessing anything unusual. Emily was quick to point out Benjamin's quietness, while Sophia pointed out my leadership in the conversation. Meanwhile, Victoria defended Emily. I need to make an educated guess based on my observations.]\n\nI vote for Victoria.",
        "Emily: [This is a tough decision. My initial suspicion was Benjamin because of his quietness, but he has since participated in the discussion. Sophia questioned Thomas, which could be seen as suspicious, but she might just be thorough. Victoria questioned my suspicion of Benjamin, which is entirely fair. I must choose carefully.]\n\nI vote for Benjamin.",
        "Benjamin: [My priority is to protect myself and Sophia. I can't vote for Victoria since Thomas just did, and voting for Emily will only draw more suspicion on me. I need to vote for someone who didn't draw much attention during the discussion.]\n\nI vote for Thomas.",
        "Sophia: [Benjamin and I are Werewolves, so I can't vote for him. I'll vote for Thomas to tie the vote and protect Benjamin.] I vote for Thomas.",
        "Victoria: [Thomas was leading the conversation, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's the Werewolf. Emily was observant, but her quick suspicion of Benjamin could be her trying to shift blame. Benjamin was quiet initially, but he's actively participated since and his voting for Thomas could be self-defense. Sophia has been consistent in scrutinizing everyone, including Thomas. Based on the information we have, Emily's eagerness to suspect Benjamin without solid evidence seems most suspicious.]\n\nI vote for Emily."
