        "Thomas:  I can't believe Bob is gone! We need to work together and find this werewolf before it's too late. Did anyone notice anything strange last night?",
        "Emily:  I didn't hear anything unusual last night, but I agree we need to find the werewolf. We should share our thoughts and try to identify any odd behavior.",
        "Benjamin:  I didn't hear anything either, but we must be careful not to let fear cloud our judgment. Let's discuss any possible suspicions and try to make a well-informed decision.",
        "Sophia:  I agree, we need to analyze everyone's actions and words closely. What were each of you doing last night before going to sleep? Let's start with you, Thomas.",
        "Thomas:  Last night, I cooked myself dinner, read a book by the fireplace, and went to bed early. I was exhausted from a long day of work. How about you, Victoria?",
        "Victoria:  Last night, I was mending some clothes by the candlelight and then went to bed. It was a quiet evening for me. What about you, Emily?",
        "Emily:  Last night, I was just writing in my journal before going to sleep. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary. How about you, Sophia?",
        "Sophia:  Last night, I was tidying up my house after dinner and then retired to bed early. Benjamin, it's your turn to share your activities from last night.",
        "Benjamin: Last night, I was working on some wood carvings in my workshop before heading to bed. It's a hobby of mine to pass the time. Nothing out of the ordinary for me either.",
        "Victoria:  Okay, so it seems no one did anything unusual last night. Let's focus on finding any inconsistencies in our behavior or odd reactions during our discussions. Keep your eyes and ears open, everyone. We need to identify the werewolf among us.",
        "Thomas:  You're right, Victoria. We should carefully observe everyone's behavior and reactions. Let's make sure we share any suspicions openly, so we can make an informed decision when it's time to vote.",
        "Emily:  You know, I think Sophia's story sounds a bit too tidy. It's as if she's trying to make herself sound innocent. What do you all think?",
        "Sophia:  I understand your concern, Emily, but my story is true. We should focus on finding inconsistencies and odd reactions instead of making baseless accusations. Benjamin, you were in your workshop last night - anyone could vouch for that?",
        "Benjamin: Actually, no one can vouch for me, since I was alone in my workshop. But I imagine most of us were alone, given the quiet evening we all seem to have had. We should keep observing each other's behavior and be vigilant for any possible clues.",
        "Victoria:  I agree with Sophia and Benjamin. Baseless accusations will only create tension and distrust among us. We need to focus on finding tangible clues and inconsistencies in our stories or behavior. Let's stay vigilant and keep the discussion going.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas:  I vote for Emily.",
        "Emily:  After listening to everyone's stories, I still think Sophia's story is too tidy and made up to sound innocent. Therefore, I vote for Sophia.",
        "Benjamin:  I vote for Sophia.",
        "Sophia: \nI vote for Emily.",
        "Victoria:  I vote for Emily."

        "Thomas: [This is awful, Bob is dead. I need to stay focused and analyze everyone's behavior. I need to get rid of the werewolf as soon as possible.] I can't believe Bob is gone! We need to work together and find this werewolf before it's too late. Did anyone notice anything strange last night?",
        "Emily: [Stay calm and focus on blending in] I didn't hear anything unusual last night, but I agree we need to find the werewolf. We should share our thoughts and try to identify any odd behavior.",
        "Benjamin: [Act normal, don't be defensive.] I didn't hear anything either, but we must be careful not to let fear cloud our judgment. Let's discuss any possible suspicions and try to make a well-informed decision.",
        "Sophia: [Thinking: I should pay attention to everyone's behavior and try to find any inconsistencies.] I agree, we need to analyze everyone's actions and words closely. What were each of you doing last night before going to sleep? Let's start with you, Thomas.",
        "Thomas: [I was just at home, minding my own business. But I need to present my alibi convincingly to avoid suspicion.] Last night, I cooked myself dinner, read a book by the fireplace, and went to bed early. I was exhausted from a long day of work. How about you, Victoria?",
        "Victoria: [Hmm, I need to give a simple but convincing alibi.] Last night, I was mending some clothes by the candlelight and then went to bed. It was a quiet evening for me. What about you, Emily?",
        "Emily: [Keep it simple and believable] Last night, I was just writing in my journal before going to sleep. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary. How about you, Sophia?",
        "Sophia: [Thinking: Their stories seem normal so far, but I should remain cautious.] Last night, I was tidying up my house after dinner and then retired to bed early. Benjamin, it's your turn to share your activities from last night.",
        "Benjamin: Last night, I was working on some wood carvings in my workshop before heading to bed. It's a hobby of mine to pass the time. Nothing out of the ordinary for me either.",
        "Victoria: [Interesting, everyone seems to have a simple alibi. Time to observe their behavior more closely.] Okay, so it seems no one did anything unusual last night. Let's focus on finding any inconsistencies in our behavior or odd reactions during our discussions. Keep your eyes and ears open, everyone. We need to identify the werewolf among us.",
        "Thomas: [Victoria seems to be leading the conversation. Is she trying to deflect suspicion, or is she genuinely trying to help? I need to be cautious with my words.] You're right, Victoria. We should carefully observe everyone's behavior and reactions. Let's make sure we share any suspicions openly, so we can make an informed decision when it's time to vote.",
        "Emily: [Time to sow some doubt] You know, I think Sophia's story sounds a bit too tidy. It's as if she's trying to make herself sound innocent. What do you all think?",
        "Sophia: [Thinking: Emily is trying to cast suspicion on me. I need to defend myself without appearing overly defensive.] I understand your concern, Emily, but my story is true. We should focus on finding inconsistencies and odd reactions instead of making baseless accusations. Benjamin, you were in your workshop last night - anyone could vouch for that?",
        "Benjamin: Actually, no one can vouch for me, since I was alone in my workshop. But I imagine most of us were alone, given the quiet evening we all seem to have had. We should keep observing each other's behavior and be vigilant for any possible clues.",
        "Victoria: [Emily's suspicion of Sophia might be a diversion tactic. Keep an eye on Emily.] I agree with Sophia and Benjamin. Baseless accusations will only create tension and distrust among us. We need to focus on finding tangible clues and inconsistencies in our stories or behavior. Let's stay vigilant and keep the discussion going.",
        "Thomas: [Emily's accusation against Sophia seemed too quick, which makes me suspicious of her motives. Victoria and Benjamin both could be trying to deflect suspicion by agreeing with each other. But I need to make a choice.] I vote for Emily.",
        "Emily: [If I don't act fast, I could be voted out. Time to convince them they've made the wrong choice] After listening to everyone's stories, I still think Sophia's story is too tidy and made up to sound innocent. Therefore, I vote for Sophia.",
        "Benjamin: [Emily is my fellow werewolf, so I can't vote for her. Sophia is already being accused, so it's better to blend in and not draw attention to myself.] I vote for Sophia.",
        "Sophia: [Thinking: Emily is eager to cast suspicion on me, but her story was rather ordinary as well. Thomas and Benjamin both seem genuine, but without any strong evidence, I have to take a decision. It's important to stay united with my fellow villagers to eliminate the werewolf threat.]\nI vote for Emily.",
        "Victoria: [Emily and Sophia both have two votes each. Benjamin was alone in his workshop, but so were most of us. Thomas was first to share his activity but didn't point fingers at anyone. Emily was quick to accuse Sophia, perhaps to divert attention from herself. I have to make a decision now.] I vote for Emily."
