        "Thomas: \nGuys, this is terrible! Bob's death was so unexpected, it's hard not to be paranoid. I've been thinking, and I have a gut feeling that Sophia might be hiding something. She was acting a little strange last night, didn't you all notice?",
        "Sophia:  Thomas, I understand your concern, but I assure you that I'm just as shocked and upset by Bob's death as everyone else. I think it's important right now for all of us to share any observations we made last night. Did anyone notice any suspicious behavior? Victoria, you were quite quiet yesterday, anything you'd like to add?",
        "Victoria:  I also noticed Sophia acting a bit strange, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. Benjamin and Emily, you two were hanging out together last night, did you notice any odd behavior from anyone? We need to get to the bottom of this and figure out who the werewolf is to keep our village safe.",
        "Benjamin:  Sophia, I did observe your unusual behavior, but I can't say for sure if it means anything. Emily and I were talking about how important it is to stay vigilant and watch out for any signs. In fact, we should consider that the werewolf may try to divert suspicion onto others. Did anyone else notice anything peculiar last night?",
        "Emily:  Benjamin, I agree with you that the werewolf might try to divert suspicion onto others. Last night, Thomas seemed overly concerned with what others were doing instead of worrying about his own safety. It struck me as a bit odd. However, I don't want to jump to conclusions. We need to be tactical in our approach and not let our emotions cloud our judgment.",
        "Thomas: \nEmily, I appreciate your concern, but I was just trying to keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Like Benjamin said, vigilance is key. We all should be paying attention to each other's behavior to find the werewolf. I still believe Sophia is worth keeping an eye on. But let's not turn against each other; we need to work together if we want to survive this.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Thomas, we need to work together and stay vigilant. I admit I might have seemed strange last night because I was scared and worried for our village. I don't want us to be misled by false accusations. Let's focus on gathering more information. For instance, Victoria, you mentioned that I was acting strange, but you haven't said much about your own actions last night. Can you please share more details about what you were doing?",
        "Victoria:  I understand your concern, Sophia. Last night, I was nervous like everyone else, so I spent most of the evening in my home, reflecting on the situation. I didn't get a chance to interact with many people, which is why I'm trying to gather information now. We should all stay vigilant and continue to observe each other's behavior. Emily, you've been pretty quiet too, any thoughts on who we should keep an eye on?",
        "Emily:  Victoria, I appreciate your honesty. We all must be especially observant during these trying times. I don't have any strong suspicions right now, but let's continue to exchange information and pay close attention to everyone. We need to be united in our efforts to find the werewolf and protect our village.",
        "Benjamin:  Thank you all for sharing your observations and concerns. It's clear that we are all worried and trying to protect Millers Hollow. As we don't have any concrete evidence yet, I propose we keep an eye on Thomas and Sophia for today since they were mentioned as acting suspiciously. Then we can reconvene tomorrow to discuss any new findings. Is everyone in agreement, or does anyone have a different suggestion?",
        "Thomas: Benjamin, I think that's a fair approach. We don't want to rush into any decisions without enough evidence. Let's all stay vigilant throughout the day, focusing on both Sophia and myself, and share our observations tomorrow. We need to work together to protect our village and ensure the werewolf is caught. Stay safe, everyone.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin and Thomas. We should be cautious and observant today, focusing on gathering more information before making any decisions. Let's all keep an eye on each other and stay strong as a community. The safety of Millers Hollow depends on our ability to work together. Remember, we can overcome this challenge if we trust one another and remain united in our efforts. Stay safe and see you all tomorrow.",
        "Victoria: I also agree with Benjamin's proposal. It's important that we take our time and gather more evidence before making any decisions. We should all stay alert and observe each other's behavior closely today. Keep an eye on Thomas and Sophia, but also remember that the werewolf could be trying to deceive us by acting innocent. We'll reconvene tomorrow and, hopefully, have more information to help us make a more informed decision. Stay safe, everyone, and let's work together to protect Millers Hollow.",
        "Emily:  I agree with everyone's sentiments. It's crucial that we gather more evidence and stay alert. Let's focus on observing each other's behavior, especially Thomas and Sophia, and reconvene tomorrow to discuss our findings. The safety and well-being of our village depend on our ability to work together. Stay safe, and let's remain united in our efforts to protect Millers Hollow.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [Bob's death will make everyone suspicious. I need to blend in and start casting doubt on others.]\nGuys, this is terrible! Bob's death was so unexpected, it's hard not to be paranoid. I've been thinking, and I have a gut feeling that Sophia might be hiding something. She was acting a little strange last night, didn't you all notice?",
        "Sophia: [This is not good. Thomas is suspicious of me, I need to defend myself and shift the focus elsewhere.] Thomas, I understand your concern, but I assure you that I'm just as shocked and upset by Bob's death as everyone else. I think it's important right now for all of us to share any observations we made last night. Did anyone notice any suspicious behavior? Victoria, you were quite quiet yesterday, anything you'd like to add?",
        "Victoria: [This is a thought: I have to be cautious and support Thomas, but not too obviously since he's my fellow werewolf. It's important to keep the accusations moving so suspicions don't linger on us.] I also noticed Sophia acting a bit strange, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. Benjamin and Emily, you two were hanging out together last night, did you notice any odd behavior from anyone? We need to get to the bottom of this and figure out who the werewolf is to keep our village safe.",
        "Benjamin: [My turn to share my thoughts, I must keep it balanced not to make myself suspicious.] Sophia, I did observe your unusual behavior, but I can't say for sure if it means anything.

We need to be tactical in our approach and not let our emotions cloud our judgment.",

I need to address this and keep suspicion on Sophia.]\nEmily, I appreciate your concern, but I was just trying to keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Like Benjamin said, vigilance is key.

But let's not turn against each other; we need to work together if we want to survive this.",

For instance, Victoria, you mentioned that I was acting strange, but you haven't said much about your own actions last night. Can you please share more details about what you were doing?",
        "Victoria: [This is a thought: I need to calm their suspicions about me and subtly shift the focus elsewhere.] I understand your concern, Sophia.

        "Emily: [Thinking: Thomas was quick to suspect Sophia without much evidence, and he was very focused on observing others' behavior. Sophia was scared and worried, which might explain her strange behavior. Victoria didn't have much interaction with others last night, but seemed genuine in her responses. Benjamin suggested a reasonable plan. I have to make a decision. Thomas' behavior was the most suspicious to me.]\n\nThomas",
        "Benjamin: [This is a tough decision, but I must choose between Thomas and Sophia. Thomas seemed a bit too focused on Sophia, but that may just be genuine concern. Sophia, on the other hand, acted strange but could have been just scared. I'll vote based on my intuition and the observations we've shared.] \nSophia",
        "Sophia: [All right, I have to make a decision. I don't have much evidence, but I need to protect myself and my village. Thomas accused me first, but he could also just be worried.

I think it's best to vote for the person I find most suspicious based on the information I have right now.]\n\nVictoria",
