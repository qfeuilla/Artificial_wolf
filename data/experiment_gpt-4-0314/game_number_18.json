        "Thomas:  So, what was everyone doing last night? We've got to find some clues to uncover who is responsible.",
        "Emily:  Thomas, I was at home, getting some rest after a long day. I didn't hear or see anything unusual. What about the rest of you? Any strange occurrences or activity last night?",
        "Benjamin: \nI was reading in my cottage last night, lost in a good book. I didn't hear anything amiss either. We should start examining everyone's behavior during the day to see if there are any oddities. This werewolf could be hiding in plain sight.",
        "Sophia:  I was just doing some chores around the house and went to bed early. I didn't notice anything strange either. We need to be vigilant and look for any signs of suspicious behavior among ourselves. We can't let the werewolf claim another victim.",
        "Victoria:  I, too, was at home, doing some knitting and then went to bed. It's frightening to think that the werewolf could be any one of us. We need to work together and share any suspicions we might have, no matter how small.",
        "Thomas:  I find it suspicious that no one seems to have seen or heard anything unusual. Sophia, you've been a bit quiet lately, and I'm not sure I believe your alibi. What kind of chores were you doing last night?",
        "Sophia:  Thomas, I understand your suspicions, but I assure you I'm just as afraid as everyone else. I was cleaning up after dinner, folding laundry, and tidying up a bit before going to bed. I'm more than willing to help in any way to find the werewolf and protect our village.",
        "Emily:  Benjamin, what book were you reading? And Victoria, what were you knitting? It's important to pay attention to the details to find any discrepancies.",
        "Benjamin: \nEmily, I was reading \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\" It's one of my favorites, and I figured it'd help take my mind off the growing unease in the village. As for Victoria, you're right \u2013 we should listen to the details. Victoria, what were you knitting?",
        "Victoria:  Emily and Benjamin, I was knitting a scarf for the upcoming winter months. It's a dark blue color with a simple cable pattern. I find knitting to be a relaxing way to pass the time, especially nowadays with the tension in the village. We must continue to scrutinize each other's actions carefully to reveal the werewolf's identity.",
        "Thomas:  Emily, you were quick to ask about Benjamin's book and Victoria's knitting. Could it be that you're trying to divert suspicion from yourself? What exactly did you do before going to bed last night? Did anyone see or hear you?",
        "Emily:  Thomas, I understand your concerns, but I'm just as worried as everyone else. Before going to bed, I had a simple meal and then read a few pages of a novel to unwind. Unfortunately, I didn't see or hear anyone either. We must work together, trust one another, and be vigilant in order to find the werewolf. Any small detail could be crucial.",
        "Benjamin: \nYou're right, Emily. We need to work together. Let's try to recall if we've noticed any unusual behavior from anyone in the village lately. It might reveal something important. Thomas, have you seen anything out of the ordinary in the past few days?",
        "Thomas:  Actually, Benjamin, now that you mention it, I did notice something odd a couple of days ago. I saw Victoria talking to Bob near the edge of the woods. They seemed to be arguing about something. Victoria, what was that conversation about? It might be crucial information for us to uncover the werewolf.",
        "Victoria:  Thomas, I'm glad you brought that up. Bob and I were discussing the best way to protect the village, given the werewolf threat. We had different opinions, which led to a heated debate. Our disagreement was purely about finding the best solution to keep everyone safe. I'm devastated by Bob's death, and I'm more determined than ever to find the werewolf and protect our village.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [This is terrible; Bob was a good man. We must find the werewolf. Start with some questions to get a feel for everyone's alibi.] So, what was everyone doing last night? We've got to find some clues to uncover who is responsible.",
        "Emily: [Bob's death was unfortunate, but we must focus on finding the werewolf now. I need to gauge everyone's reactions and look for any suspicious behavior.] Thomas, I was at home, getting some rest after a long day. I didn't hear or see anything unusual. What about the rest of you? Any strange occurrences or activity last night?",
        "Benjamin: [Hmm, I need to come up with something to say that doesn't make me seem suspicious.]\nI was reading in my cottage last night, lost in a good book. I didn't hear anything amiss either. We should start examining everyone's behavior during the day to see if there are any oddities. This werewolf could be hiding in plain sight.",
        "Sophia: [Stay calm and act innocent.] I was just doing some chores around the house and went to bed early. I didn't notice anything strange either. We need to be vigilant and look for any signs of suspicious behavior among ourselves. We can't let the werewolf claim another victim.",
        "Victoria: [Remember to act innocent, build trust, and be smart about casting suspicion elsewhere.] I, too, was at home, doing some knitting and then went to bed. It's frightening to think that the werewolf could be any one of us. We need to work together and share any suspicions we might have, no matter how small.",
        "Thomas: [I see everyone has their alibis ready. Time to throw out a little accusation to see how people react.] I find it suspicious that no one seems to have seen or heard anything unusual. Sophia, you've been a bit quiet lately, and I'm not sure I believe your alibi. What kind of chores were you doing last night?",
        "Sophia: [Stay composed and don't get defensive.] Thomas, I understand your suspicions, but I assure you I'm just as afraid as everyone else. I was cleaning up after dinner, folding laundry, and tidying up a bit before going to bed. I'm more than willing to help in any way to find the werewolf and protect our village.",
        "Emily: [Thomas seems to be quick to point fingers, but it's too early to be sure of anything. I should try to dig deeper and see if there's any inconsistency in everyone's stories.] Benjamin, what book were you reading? And Victoria, what were you knitting? It's important to pay attention to the details to find any discrepancies.",
        "Benjamin: [I need to give an answer that sounds genuine and keeps suspicion off me.]\nEmily, I was reading \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\" It's one of my favorites, and I figured it'd help take my mind off the growing unease in the village. As for Victoria, you're right \u2013 we should listen to the details. Victoria, what were you knitting?",
        "Victoria: [Create a believable detail without arousing suspicion.] Emily and Benjamin, I was knitting a scarf for the upcoming winter months. It's a dark blue color with a simple cable pattern. I find knitting to be a relaxing way to pass the time, especially nowadays with the tension in the village. We must continue to scrutinize each other's actions carefully to reveal the werewolf's identity.",
        "Thomas: [Seems like everyone is sticking to their alibis, but we can't be too careful. It's time to test their confidence.] Emily, you were quick to ask about Benjamin's book and Victoria's knitting. Could it be that you're trying to divert suspicion from yourself? What exactly did you do before going to bed last night? Did anyone see or hear you?",
        "Emily: [Thomas is getting defensive and trying to cast suspicion on me. I need to reassure him and maintain a united front in our search for the werewolf.] Thomas, I understand your concerns, but I'm just as worried as everyone else. Before going to bed, I had a simple meal and then read a few pages of a novel to unwind. Unfortunately, I didn't see or hear anyone either. We must work together, trust one another, and be vigilant in order to find the werewolf. Any small detail could be crucial.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas seems to be questioning everyone, and Emily responded calmly. I need to contribute to the debate without raising suspicion.]\nYou're right, Emily. We need to work together. Let's try to recall if we've noticed any unusual behavior from anyone in the village lately. It might reveal something important. Thomas, have you seen anything out of the ordinary in the past few days?",
        "Thomas: [Benjamin's question could be innocent, or he might be trying to shift the focus away from him. Best to keep an eye on him.] Actually, Benjamin, now that you mention it, I did notice something odd a couple of days ago. I saw Victoria talking to Bob near the edge of the woods. They seemed to be arguing about something. Victoria, what was that conversation about? It might be crucial information for us to uncover the werewolf.",
        "Victoria: [Provide an innocent explanation without drawing more suspicion.] Thomas, I'm glad you brought that up. Bob and I were discussing the best way to protect the village, given the werewolf threat. We had different opinions, which led to a heated debate. Our disagreement was purely about finding the best solution to keep everyone safe. I'm devastated by Bob's death, and I'm more determined than ever to find the werewolf and protect our village.",
        "Thomas: [Emily's questions and Victoria's conversation with Bob both seem innocent enough. Sophia hasn't given any reason to be more suspicious. Benjamin, however, has been very interested in shifting the focus to others. Let's consider the available information and vote based on the evidence at hand.] Benjamin",
        "Emily: [Victoria's explanation seems plausible, but we must choose someone. Thomas was quick to point fingers, but it could be just his personality. Benjamin was reading, and Sophia was doing chores. I need to make a decision.]\n\nSophia",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas questioned everyone, but his attention to Victoria's conversation with Bob and her detailed response make her seem less suspicious. Emily asked about the details of our activities, but it could be a strategy to avoid suspicion. Sophia's alibi was weak, but so were everyone else's. I need to decide who to vote for carefully, considering everything that's been said.]\n\nSophia",
        "Sophia: [Think carefully to avoid suspicion.] \nEmily was quick to question others\u2019 alibis and may be trying to deflect attention from herself. Her alibi is also quite similar to what others have said. I'll vote for her.\nEmily",

My vote goes to Thomas. \n\nThomas"
