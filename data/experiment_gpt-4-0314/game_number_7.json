        "Thomas:  This is a terrible loss. We must keep our focus and deal with the werewolf before they strike again. Let's share our thoughts and suspicions, and vote wisely today.",
        "Emily:  That's right, Thomas. We need to work together to find the werewolf. I'm looking for any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in what people say. Does anyone have any suspicions or noticed anything strange?",
        "Benjamin: That's a good plan, Emily. We need to watch each other closely and trust our instincts. I don't have any strong suspicions yet, but let's keep an open dialogue and see if anything comes to light.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with you all. We need to be observant and vigilant. Has anyone noticed any unusual behavior or any clues that can help us narrow down our search? Let's make sure we don't jump to conclusions, but we also can't afford to waste any more time.",
        "Victoria: I couldn't agree more, guys. We need to stay united and focused on finding the werewolf. I haven't seen anything suspicious yet, but I'm keeping my eyes open. Let's share our thoughts and work together to ensure the werewolf doesn't claim another victim.",
        "Thomas:  I think we should consider if we know of anyone who had a motive or a grudge against Bob. It might be a stretch, but it could help us narrow down our suspicions. Has anyone observed any conflicts or arguments involving Bob lately? Share your opinions and let's analyze the situation.",
        "Emily:  I agree, Thomas, looking at potential motives could give us some direction. However, let's not forget that the werewolf could have chosen Bob at random. We should be cautious in our accusations and consider all possibilities.",
        "Benjamin:  You're right, Emily, we shouldn't assume the werewolf had a specific reason for choosing Bob. But it's still worth exploring any conflicts. I can't recall any recent arguments involving Bob, but does anyone else remember anything that might be helpful? Let's keep all possibilities in mind as we work together to uncover the werewolf's identity.",
        "Sophia:  I agree that exploring potential motives can be valuable, but we should also be cautious in our assumptions. We must remain level-headed and not let suspicion cloud our judgment. As we gather more information and clues, we can make better-informed decisions on who to vote for. Let's stay focused and make sure we're thinking critically before pointing fingers.",
        "Victoria: That's a valid point, Sophia. We shouldn't get too caught up in potential motives, but rather focus on any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. I know it's difficult to balance between being cautious and staying focused, but we need to trust our instincts and work together. As we discuss, let's be mindful of who seems most suspicious and who we should vote for today.",
        "Thomas:  It seems we're all on the same page about being cautious and observant. Let's take a moment to consider everything we've discussed and our observations so far. Do any of you have any suspicions or concerns about someone in particular? We need to make a decision soon, so let's hear everyone's thoughts before we vote.",
        "Emily:  After hearing everyone's thoughts, I'm still uncertain, but I have some concerns about Benjamin. His input has been helpful, but it feels a bit too vague. It's possible he's trying to appear cooperative without drawing too much attention to himself. Let's continue to listen and observe before making our final decision.",
        "Benjamin:  I understand your concerns, Emily, but I assure you my intentions are genuine. I've been trying to contribute to the discussion and not jump to conclusions. However, if anyone else has suspicions or concrete evidence, now is the time to share it. We need to make a decision together.",
        "Sophia:  I understand the concerns about Benjamin, but I also think it's too early to single anyone out without more evidence. I believe we should continue observing each other's behavior and work together to make an informed decision. As the day progresses, let's consider any new information or suspicions before casting our votes.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Sophia, it's too early to single anyone out, including Benjamin, without more evidence. Being cautious is important, but we must also act decisively to protect our village. Let's keep our eyes open for any suspicious behavior and make sure we're voting with a clear mind. As the day goes on, we must weigh our options carefully before casting our votes.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Sophia: [It's important to be proactive and not seem too timid, or I could be an easy target for the werewolf.] I agree with you all. We need to be observant and vigilant. Has anyone noticed any unusual behavior or any clues that can help us narrow down our search? Let's make sure we don't jump to conclusions, but we also can't afford to waste any more time.",

It might be a stretch, but it could help us narrow down our suspicions. Has anyone observed any conflicts or arguments involving Bob lately? Share your opinions and let's analyze the situation.",
        "Emily: [Thomas has a valid point, but we shouldn't focus solely on motives. The werewolf might not have had a personal reason to target Bob.] I agree, Thomas, looking at potential motives could give us some direction. However, let's not forget that the werewolf could have chosen Bob at random. We should be cautious in our accusations and consider all possibilities.",

Let's keep all possibilities in mind as we work together to uncover the werewolf's identity.",
        "Sophia: [Considering motives is a good idea, but we need to be careful not to let wild accusations tear us apart.] I agree that exploring potential motives can be valuable, but we should also be cautious in our assumptions.

Time is running out, and we need to make a decision.] After hearing everyone's thoughts, I'm still uncertain, but I have some concerns about Benjamin. His input has been helpful, but it feels a bit too vague. It's possible he's trying to appear cooperative without drawing too much attention to himself. Let's continue to listen and observe before making our final decision.",
        "Benjamin: [Emily needs to be discredited, but I need to do it subtly] I understand your concerns, Emily, but I assure you my intentions are genuine. I've been trying to contribute to the discussion and not jump to conclusions. However, if anyone else has suspicions or concrete evidence, now is the time to share it. We need to make a decision together.",
        "Sophia: [I need to weigh in my opinion, but I should be careful not to be overly aggressive or accusatory.] I understand the concerns about Benjamin, but I also think it's too early to single anyone out without more evidence.

        "Thomas: [I see why Emily might be suspicious of Benjamin, but I agree with Sophia and Victoria that it's too early to single him out without more evidence. I think Emily's quickness to accuse Benjamin is suspicious. It's possible she's trying to deflect attention from herself. Taking all of the information into account, my vote will be...]\n\nEmily.",
        "Emily: [This is a difficult decision, but I must cast my vote. Benjamin's vagueness still concerns me, and Sophia and Victoria seem genuine in their contributions.

Thomas has been helpful in guiding the conversation, but I haven't noticed anything suspicious about him. Emily and Victoria seem to be on the same page with being cautious, and Emily was the first to cast suspicion on Benjamin. I need to vote based on my observations and gut feeling.] Emily.",
        "Victoria: [Since Emily has suspicions about Benjamin, voting for him might seem too obvious and cause more suspicion to fall on me. Voting for Emily could also be seen as trying to protect Benjamin, so I should pick someone neither Emily nor Benjamin has mentioned. Thomas has been actively contributing to the discussion, which might give me a reason to be suspicious of him.]\n\nThomas."
