        "Thomas: \n\nGuys, this is terrible! Bob is dead... What were you all doing last night when this happened? I was fixing a leak in my roof, so I didn't see anything suspicious. Did any of you notice something out of the ordinary?",
        "Emily:  I was at home, reading by candlelight. I didn't hear anything unusual last night. It's tragic what happened to Bob, but jumping to conclusions won't help us find the werewolf. Let's stay calm and think this through. Any unusual behavior among us lately?",
        "Benjamin:  Last night, I was helping my neighbor with their harvest. I didn't see anything suspicious either. We should be cautious with our accusations, but pay close attention to everyone's words and actions. Did anyone see or hear anything unusual lately?",
        "Sophia:  Last night, I was cooking dinner and then went to bed early. I didn't notice anything strange, but I agree with Benjamin, we should be cautious and observe everyone's actions and words carefully. Let's also consider if anyone had a reason to target Bob specifically.",
        "Victoria:  Last night, I was knitting by the fireplace when I heard some rustling outside my window. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now I'm wondering if it was the werewolf. We must be vigilant and share any information we have, no matter how small. Let's work together to find the werewolf and save our village. And about Bob, he was a kind-hearted person, but he did have disagreements with some villagers. Could this be a motive for the werewolf?",
        "Thomas: \n\nYou're right, Victoria. We should consider motives. I remember Bob having a heated argument with Sophia a few weeks back over a land dispute. Sophia, can you explain the situation and why you think it wouldn't provoke you to harm Bob? We need to share every piece of information we have to solve this mystery together.",
        "Sophia:  Yes, it's true, Bob and I had a disagreement over land, but we resolved it peacefully shortly after. I wouldn't have any reason to harm him. I think we should focus on finding the werewolf rather than dwelling on past differences. Let's look for any strange behavior or inconsistencies in each other's stories.",
        "Emily:  I agree with Sophia, let's focus on finding the werewolf. We should watch every aspect of our behavior and communication. If we work together and share information, we can identify the menace and protect our village. As for me, I didn't have any issue with Bob, and I'm determined to find the werewolf.",
        "Benjamin:  Indeed, let's concentrate on identifying the werewolf. We have little time, and focusing on past feuds may lead us astray. I too had no issues with Bob, and I am committed to protecting our village. Let's remember to be cautious and not rule out anyone based on just one suspicion. Keep your eyes and ears open, and together we can unmask the werewolf.",
        "Victoria:  I agree with all of you. We should focus on identifying the werewolf and not let past disagreements cloud our judgment. I suggest we all closely observe each other's behavior and discuss any new information we gather. Let's work as a team to save our village. We must be cautious, but at the same time, we can't afford to waste any more time. Stay strong, everyone.",
        "Thomas: \n\nIt's crucial that we work together and pay attention to the smallest details. Since we're all committed to finding the werewolf, we should also consider if anyone had an alibi last night. We already shared our activities, but did anyone have a witness or any solid evidence that could clear their name or put suspicion on others? Every piece of information is vital to our survival.",
        "Emily:  That's a good point, Thomas. I don't have a solid alibi, just my word that I was reading at home. However, let's keep a close eye on each other's behavior and think about any new information that might come up. We should also consider that the werewolf might manipulate us or fabricate alibis to divert suspicion. Stay alert, everyone.",
        "Benjamin:  My neighbor can vouch for me helping with their harvest last night. But you're right, Emily, the werewolf could manipulate us or create false alibis. We must be diligent in evaluating the information we share and think critically about each other's behavior. Let's keep our minds open and stay alert. Time is running out, and we need to act soon.",
        "Sophia:  Thomas brings up a good point. Unfortunately, I don't have a witness, but I stand by my word that I was cooking and went to bed early. Let's not forget that the werewolf could be amongst us, pretending to cooperate. We must scrutinize everyone's actions and stories carefully. We need to make a decision soon, but let's not rush into it without proper reasoning.",
        "Victoria:  Although most of us don't have solid alibis, we must rely on our intuition and keen observation. It's essential that we remain vigilant and analyze everything we know. Let's focus on any inconsistencies or secretive behavior among us. Time is of the essence, and we must make a decision soon to protect our village. Remember, the werewolf could be hiding in plain sight, so trust carefully, and stay strong.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [Bob is dead. I need to move suspicion away from myself and Emily. Let's start by inquiring about people's actions during the night.]\n\nGuys, this is terrible! Bob is dead... What were you all doing last night when this happened? I was fixing a leak in my roof, so I didn't see anything suspicious. Did any of you notice something out of the ordinary?",
        "Emily: [Alright, time to act innocent and not arouse suspicion.] I was at home, reading by candlelight. I didn't hear anything unusual last night. It's tragic what happened to Bob, but jumping to conclusions won't help us find the werewolf. Let's stay calm and think this through. Any unusual behavior among us lately?",
        "Benjamin: [Emily is right, we need to stay calm and think. But I should also keep an eye on everyone's behavior.] Last night, I was helping my neighbor with their harvest. I didn't see anything suspicious either. We should be cautious with our accusations, but pay close attention to everyone's words and actions. Did anyone see or hear anything unusual lately?",
        "Sophia: [It's important to keep an eye on everyone and not trust anyone too easily. I should also mention what I was doing last night to avoid suspicion.] Last night, I was cooking dinner and then went to bed early. I didn't notice anything strange, but I agree with Benjamin, we should be cautious and observe everyone's actions and words carefully. Let's also consider if anyone had a reason to target Bob specifically.",
        "Victoria: [This is a difficult situation, but I need to speak up and share my thoughts.] Last night, I was knitting by the fireplace when I heard some rustling outside my window.

        "Thomas: [Victoria brings up a valid point about motives. I should also share some information to gain trust.]\n\nYou're right, Victoria. We should consider motives. I remember Bob having a heated argument with Sophia a few weeks back over a land dispute. Sophia, can you explain the situation and why you think it wouldn't provoke you to harm Bob? We need to share every piece of information we have to solve this mystery together.",
        "Sophia: [Thomas pointing out my argument with Bob could make me look suspicious, I need to address it carefully and shift the focus back to finding the werewolf.] Yes, it's true, Bob and I had a disagreement over land, but we resolved it peacefully shortly after. I wouldn't have any reason to harm him. I think we should focus on finding the werewolf rather than dwelling on past differences. Let's look for any strange behavior or inconsistencies in each other's stories.",
        "Emily: [Thomas, my fellow werewolf, is getting a bit aggressive. I need to be careful with my words.] I agree with Sophia, let's focus on finding the werewolf. We should watch every aspect of our behavior and communication. If we work together and share information, we can identify the menace and protect our village. As for me, I didn't have any issue with Bob, and I'm determined to find the werewolf.",

        "Thomas: [Everyone seems to be in agreement. We must be cautious but vigilant. Let's bring up another point to consider.]\n\nIt's crucial that we work together and pay attention to the smallest details. Since we're all committed to finding the werewolf, we should also consider if anyone had an alibi last night. We already shared our activities, but did anyone have a witness or any solid evidence that could clear their name or put suspicion on others? Every piece of information is vital to our survival.",
        "Emily: [Thomas is pushing hard. I need to be cautious but stay engaged in the conversation.] That's a good point, Thomas. I don't have a solid alibi, just my word that I was reading at home. However, let's keep a close eye on each other's behavior and think about any new information that might come up. We should also consider that the werewolf might manipulate us or fabricate alibis to divert suspicion. Stay alert, everyone.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas is right, having an alibi or evidence can help clear our names or cast suspicion on others. I should think about my situation and encourage others to share anything they might have.] My neighbor can vouch for me helping with their harvest last night. But you're right, Emily, the werewolf could manipulate us or create false alibis. We must be diligent in evaluating the information we share and think critically about each other's behavior. Let's keep our minds open and stay alert. Time is running out, and we need to act soon.",
        "Sophia: [We should keep the pressure on, and everyone should be evaluated equally. Time is of the essence.] Thomas brings up a good point. Unfortunately, I don't have a witness, but I stand by my word that I was cooking and went to bed early. Let's not forget that the werewolf could be amongst us, pretending to cooperate. We must scrutinize everyone's actions and stories carefully. We need to make a decision soon, but let's not rush into it without proper reasoning.",
        "Victoria: [Everyone seems to be working together, but we need to act fast. We should consider everyone's alibis, but also think critically about their behavior and statements.] Although most of us don't have solid alibis, we must rely on our intuition and keen observation. It's essential that we remain vigilant and analyze everything we know. Let's focus on any inconsistencies or secretive behavior among us. Time is of the essence, and we must make a decision soon to protect our village. Remember, the werewolf could be hiding in plain sight, so trust carefully, and stay strong.",
        "Thomas: [Emily doesn't have a solid alibi, and I can't vote for myself. Benjamin's neighbor may vouch for him, but we can't be sure if he's honest. Sophia had a past dispute with Bob, but she claims it was resolved. Victoria heard rustling near her house last night, which could be a fabricated story. I need to vote strategically to protect myself and Emily. Let's go with Sophia due to her past conflict with Bob.]\n\nSophia",
        "Emily: [Since Sophia has been under suspicion due to her past disagreement with Bob, it might be a good idea to vote for her. That way, the attention will be diverted from me and Thomas, and we can stay in the game longer.] Sophia",
        "Benjamin: [Based on the information we gathered, it's difficult to pinpoint the werewolf with certainty. However, Sophia had that disagreement with Bob, even if she claims it was resolved. She also doesn't have an alibi, which increases the suspicion. I must make a decision, and given what we know, I'll have to cast my vote.] Sophia",
        "Sophia: [Considering the information we've shared, I need to make a decision and vote. Victoria mentioned hearing rustling outside her window, which seems suspicious. Additionally, she was quick to suggest that the werewolf could be hiding in plain sight. I'll cast my vote based on this reasoning.]\n\nVictoria",
        "Victoria: [This is a difficult decision, but I must consider everything we've discussed. Thomas mentioned Sophia's past argument with Bob, but she said they resolved it peacefully. Emily and Benjamin's stories seem plausible. However, Sophia doesn't have a solid alibi, and the land dispute could be a motive. I have to make a decision now to protect our village.] Sophia"
