        "Thomas:  Well, that's a terrible start to our time in Millers Hollow. We need to work together to find the werewolf. Let's start discussing our suspicions and any clues we may have found. Does anyone want to share their thoughts?",
        "Emily:  I agree with you, Thomas. We have to be vigilant and analytical in our approach. Let's keep an eye on everyone's behavior and pick up on any inconsistencies or strange actions. Trust is scarce, but cooperation is crucial.",
        "Benjamin:  I'm with you both on this. We need to stay united and observe each other's actions closely. I haven't noticed anything odd yet, but we can't afford to let our guard down. Let's keep the conversation going and try to find some clues.",
        "Sophia:  Indeed, we must remain vigilant and analyze every detail. I noticed during the night that Victoria was quite restless. Victoria, care to explain your uneasiness?",
        "Victoria:  Yes, Sophia, I was restless. I was anxious and worried for the safety of our village, knowing the werewolf is among us. I believe we need to act fast and be bold in our search. Time is of the essence.",
        "Thomas:  That's interesting, Victoria. We were all anxious, but your restlessness could be a sign. I think we need to question Victoria further. What do you think, everyone?",
        "Emily:  Thomas, while Victoria's restlessness is worth noting, it isn't concrete evidence. We should continue observing everyone's behavior and look for more incriminating clues before accusing someone. Let's keep our minds open and not focus on just one person.",
        "Benjamin:  That's a valid point, Emily. Although Victoria's restlessness might have caught our attention, it's not enough to conclusively point fingers. We should remain cautious and continue our discussions, considering other possibilities and observations before making any decisions.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Emily and Benjamin. We need more concrete evidence before we accuse someone. Victoria's restlessness could be a sign, but let's not jump to conclusions. Anyone else noticed any unusual behavior or have any other insights to share?",
        "Thomas:  You're right, Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia. We should keep an open mind and not rush our judgments. Let's continue observing everyone's behavior and gather more information. Meanwhile, let's all share our thoughts and suspicions, so we can narrow down potential werewolf candidates.",
        "Emily:  I appreciate everyone's level-headedness in this situation. We've all been feeling the pressure, but it's important to stay rational. I've been observing everyone too, but I haven't seen any clear signs of guilt or unusual behavior. Let's all keep sharing our observations and thoughts, and perhaps we'll find stronger evidence to guide our decision.",
        "Benjamin:  While I agree that we shouldn't focus solely on Victoria, I did notice that Sophia was unusually quiet during the night. It might be nothing, but I think it's worth discussing. Sophia, can you share your thoughts on this? Were you just trying to be cautious, or was there something else? Let's keep sharing our observations to make a more informed decision.",
        "Sophia:  Benjamin, my quietness was due to my attentiveness and focus on observing everyone. I wanted to be as vigilant as possible in this crucial moment. Since we're sharing our observations, I also noticed that Thomas seemed nervous during the night. Thomas, would you like to explain why? It's essential to keep all possibilities on the table.",
        "Thomas:  Sophia, I was nervous because I'm aware of the danger we're all in, and I'm trying to stay vigilant. Like everyone else, I'm concerned for our village's safety. Now, getting back to the matter at hand, have any of you noticed any other unusual actions or behavior that might help us pinpoint the werewolf among us?",
        "Emily:  I've been closely observing everyone as well, and though I haven't found any solid evidence pointing towards the werewolf, we should maintain this open dialogue and continue sharing our observations. Let's remember that the werewolf may also try to manipulate our suspicions, so staying cautious and rational is crucial.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [This is bad, they'll be suspicious of everyone now. I need to act innocent and redirect suspicion as quickly as I can.] Well, that's a terrible start to our time in Millers Hollow. We need to work together to find the werewolf. Let's start discussing our suspicions and any clues we may have found. Does anyone want to share their thoughts?",
        "Emily: [Bob's death is tragic, but we need to focus on finding the werewolf now.] I agree with you, Thomas. We have to be vigilant and analytical in our approach. Let's keep an eye on everyone's behavior and pick up on any inconsistencies or strange actions. Trust is scarce, but cooperation is crucial.",
        "Benjamin: [As a werewolf, I need to blend in and not raise suspicions. For now, I can agree with Thomas and Emily.] I'm with you both on this. We need to stay united and observe each other's actions closely. I haven't noticed anything odd yet, but we can't afford to let our guard down. Let's keep the conversation going and try to find some clues.",
        "Sophia: [Thomas and Emily seem to want to work together, and Benjamin agrees. No one has shown any suspicious behavior yet, but I need to make an observation.] Indeed, we must remain vigilant and analyze every detail. I noticed during the night that Victoria was quite restless. Victoria, care to explain your uneasiness?",
        "Victoria: [Hmm, Sophia is trying to raise suspicion on me from the very beginning. I must try to dispel any doubts about my innocence.] Yes, Sophia, I was restless. I was anxious and worried for the safety of our village, knowing the werewolf is among us. I believe we need to act fast and be bold in our search. Time is of the essence.",
        "Thomas: [Benjamin is my fellow werewolf, I need to avoid drawing attention to him. Victoria is a good target for suspicion now.] That's interesting, Victoria. We were all anxious, but your restlessness could be a sign. I think we need to question Victoria further. What do you think, everyone?",
        "Emily: [It's important to analyze her behavior, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions just based on restlessness.] Thomas, while Victoria's restlessness is worth noting, it isn't concrete evidence. We should continue observing everyone's behavior and look for more incriminating clues before accusing someone. Let's keep our minds open and not focus on just one person.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas' suspicion of Victoria is good for me, but I should not be too eager to agree.] That's a valid point, Emily. Although Victoria's restlessness might have caught our attention, it's not enough to conclusively point fingers. We should remain cautious and continue our discussions, considering other possibilities and observations before making any decisions.",
        "Sophia: [Emily mentioned we should continue observing everyone's behavior, while Benjamin advises caution and considering other possibilities. It's crucial to find a balance between acting swiftly and maintaining an open mind.] I agree with Emily and Benjamin. We need more concrete evidence before we accuse someone. Victoria's restlessness could be a sign, but let's not jump to conclusions. Anyone else noticed any unusual behavior or have any other insights to share?",
        "Thomas: [Emily has a point, I shouldn't be too aggressive in accusing Victoria. Let's play it safe for now.] You're right, Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia. We should keep an open mind and not rush our judgments. Let's continue observing everyone's behavior and gather more information. Meanwhile, let's all share our thoughts and suspicions, so we can narrow down potential werewolf candidates.",
        "Emily: [We need to make sure to keep the conversation going and focus on other possible clues or hints.] I appreciate everyone's level-headedness in this situation. We've all been feeling the pressure, but it's important to stay rational. I've been observing everyone too, but I haven't seen any clear signs of guilt or unusual behavior. Let's all keep sharing our observations and thoughts, and perhaps we'll find stronger evidence to guide our decision.",
        "Benjamin: [It's time to bring some suspicion on someone else, preferably someone other than Thomas, my fellow werewolf.] While I agree that we shouldn't focus solely on Victoria, I did notice that Sophia was unusually quiet during the night. It might be nothing, but I think it's worth discussing. Sophia, can you share your thoughts on this? Were you just trying to be cautious, or was there something else? Let's keep sharing our observations to make a more informed decision.",
        "Sophia: [Benjamin noticed my quietness during the night, which could be misinterpreted. I need to explain myself and keep the focus on finding more substantial evidence.] Benjamin, my quietness was due to my attentiveness and focus on observing everyone. I wanted to be as vigilant as possible in this crucial moment. Since we're sharing our observations, I also noticed that Thomas seemed nervous during the night. Thomas, would you like to explain why? It's essential to keep all possibilities on the table.",
        "Thomas: [Sophia is now suspicious of me. I need to divert attention from myself and Benjamin.] Sophia, I was nervous because I'm aware of the danger we're all in, and I'm trying to stay vigilant. Like everyone else, I'm concerned for our village's safety. Now, getting back to the matter at hand, have any of you noticed any other unusual actions or behavior that might help us pinpoint the werewolf among us?",
        "Emily: [It's important to keep the conversation going without singling anyone out prematurely.] I've been closely observing everyone as well, and though I haven't found any solid evidence pointing towards the werewolf, we should maintain this open dialogue and continue sharing our observations. Let's remember that the werewolf may also try to manipulate our suspicions, so staying cautious and rational is crucial.",
        "Thomas: [Victoria's restlessness caught my attention, but Sophia's quick diversion toward my nervousness makes her a better target. Voting for Sophia could protect Benjamin and me, and it would make it easier for us to continue our mission.] Sophia.",
        "Emily: [We have to make a decision now, no concrete evidence but we can't afford to lose. Thomas was nervous, Victoria was restless, and Sophia was unusually quiet. It could be anyone, but Sophia might be trying to manipulate the conversation. Based on the information so far, I'll cast my vote.]\n\nSophia.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas and I are both werewolves, so I should not vote for him. I must choose between Emily, Sophia, and Victoria. Voting for Sophia would add to the consensus, but I could also vote for Victoria or Emily to create uncertainty and avoid drawing attention to myself.] Victoria.",
        "Sophia: [Emily and Thomas voted for me, which is concerning. Benjamin voted for Victoria. I must think carefully before casting my vote. Thomas was nervous, and Victoria was restless. Voting for either of them would create a tie. I need to make a decision based on my observations and suspicions.] Victoria.",
        "Victoria: [This is a difficult decision, but I need to make a choice. Benjamin and Sophia voted for me, and Thomas seemed suspicious of me earlier. Sophia has been throwing suspicions on others, but I must consider all possibilities.] Thomas."
