        "Thomas: \n\nWell, it's terrible that Bob is no longer with us. I couldn't help but notice that Benjamin seemed a little on edge last night. Anyone else notice something odd about his behavior?",
        "Emily: \nI did notice Benjamin seemed a bit uneasy, but it could just be nerves from the situation we're in. Sophia, you were awfully quiet last night, anything you'd like to share with us?",
        "Sophia: \nIt's true I was quiet last night, Emily, but I was just trying to observe everyone's behavior carefully. I must admit Benjamin's uneasiness caught my attention too. However, we shouldn't jump to conclusions based on just that. Victoria, what are your thoughts on this?",
        "Victoria: \n\nYou're right, Sophia. We should be cautious about jumping to conclusions. Benjamin's uneasiness could be just as easily attributed to the fear and tension we're all experiencing. I think it's important for us to observe everyone and not just focus on one person. Emily, you seemed quite eager to hear from Sophia; is there something on your mind?",
        "Emily: \nTrue, Victoria, I may have been too quick to question Sophia. I'm just worried for our village, and I want to make sure we're considering everyone's behavior. I apologize if I seemed too eager. Let's stay observant and share any suspicions we have. Benjamin, would you like to explain your uneasiness last night?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nYes, I was uneasy last night, but so were many of us, given the circumstances. I'm just as concerned about our village as all of you. My uneasiness isn't a sign of guilt; it's a sign of fear for our safety. Now, Thomas was the first to point fingers. Why were you so quick to accuse me?",
        "Thomas: \n\nI apologize if it sounded like I was accusing you, Benjamin. I was just trying to share what I observed last night. I think we should all be open about our observations, so we can work together to find the real werewolf. So, let's not focus on just one person, but consider everyone's behavior. For instance, Victoria was rather quiet yesterday. What are your thoughts on that, Emily?",
        "Emily: \n\nI noticed Victoria's quietness too, but as Sophia mentioned earlier, some of us might be observing more than speaking. We can't be too quick to judge based on a single characteristic. We should keep an open mind and continue sharing our thoughts and observations with each other. This way, we'll have a better chance of uncovering the werewolf among us.",
        "Sophia: \nIt's clear that we're all worried and acting cautiously, but we need to make a decision today. It's unfortunate, but we must vote to eliminate someone. Let's take a moment to consider our observations and suspicions so far. Remember, the safety of Millers Hollow depends on our ability to make tough decisions. Think carefully, and then let's proceed to the voting.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [As a werewolf, I need to create some confusion and suspicion among the villagers. Let me start by shifting the focus onto someone else.]\n\nWell, it's terrible that Bob is no longer with us. I couldn't help but notice that Benjamin seemed a little on edge last night. Anyone else notice something odd about his behavior?",
        "Emily: [This is concerning, we need to find the werewolf. Thomas is suspicious of Benjamin already. Should I press Benjamin or look for other clues?]\nI did notice Benjamin seemed a bit uneasy, but it could just be nerves from the situation we're in. Sophia, you were awfully quiet last night, anything you'd like to share with us?",
        "Sophia: [Hmm, I need to make sure I don't seem too passive, but I don't want to accuse anyone without any evidence either.]\nIt's true I was quiet last night, Emily, but I was just trying to observe everyone's behavior carefully. I must admit Benjamin's uneasiness caught my attention too. However, we shouldn't jump to conclusions based on just that. Victoria, what are your thoughts on this?",
        "Victoria: [Focus on defending Thomas, my fellow werewolf, and subtly shift suspicion to someone else.]\n\nYou're right, Sophia. We should be cautious about jumping to conclusions. Benjamin's uneasiness could be just as easily attributed to the fear and tension we're all experiencing. I think it's important for us to observe everyone and not just focus on one person. Emily, you seemed quite eager to hear from Sophia; is there something on your mind?",
        "Emily: [Victoria has a point, I shouldn't narrow in on someone too quickly. I need to be vigilant and observe everyone.]\nTrue, Victoria, I may have been too quick to question Sophia. I'm just worried for our village, and I want to make sure we're considering everyone's behavior. I apologize if I seemed too eager. Let's stay observant and share any suspicions we have. Benjamin, would you like to explain your uneasiness last night?",
        "Benjamin: [Well, I'm being accused by three people already, I need to think fast and come up with a reasonable explanation for my uneasiness. I should also try to change the focus of the conversation.]\n\nYes, I was uneasy last night, but so were many of us, given the circumstances. I'm just as concerned about our village as all of you. My uneasiness isn't a sign of guilt; it's a sign of fear for our safety. Now, Thomas was the first to point fingers. Why were you so quick to accuse me?",
        "Thomas: [I should find a way to divert the attention away from me and back to someone else.]\n\nI apologize if it sounded like I was accusing you, Benjamin. I was just trying to share what I observed last night. I think we should all be open about our observations, so we can work together to find the real werewolf. So, let's not focus on just one person, but consider everyone's behavior. For instance, Victoria was rather quiet yesterday. What are your thoughts on that, Emily?",
        "Emily: [Thomas has a point; we need to consider everyone's behavior, not just Benjamin's. It's true that Victoria was quiet, but so were others. Best to stay focused on the group as a whole.]\n\nI noticed Victoria's quietness too, but as Sophia mentioned earlier, some of us might be observing more than speaking. We can't be too quick to judge based on a single characteristic. We should keep an open mind and continue sharing our thoughts and observations with each other. This way, we'll have a better chance of uncovering the werewolf among us.",
        "Sophia: [It's time to be more assertive and guide the conversation to a decisive point.]\nIt's clear that we're all worried and acting cautiously, but we need to make a decision today. It's unfortunate, but we must vote to eliminate someone. Let's take a moment to consider our observations and suspicions so far. Remember, the safety of Millers Hollow depends on our ability to make tough decisions. Think carefully, and then let's proceed to the voting.",
        "Thomas: [Considering the conversations we had, I should vote for someone who hasn't been mentioned yet to create further confusion and suspicion. Let's vote for Emily.]\n\nEmily",
        "Emily: [Thomas voted for me, but I haven't been suspicious. Benjamin was uneasy, Sophia and Victoria were quiet. Thomas was the first to cast suspicion on others. It's a tough decision, but...]\n\nThomas",
        "Benjamin: [Let's see, Thomas was quick to accuse me, but backed off when others didn't join him. Emily seemed eager to question Sophia but was also quick to defend Victoria. It's a tough call, but Emily's behavior stands out as slightly more suspicious to me.]\n\nEmily",
        "Sophia: [Thomas accused Benjamin first, but it could be an honest observation. Emily was initially suspicious of me but later admitted she was too eager. Benjamin defended himself and seemed genuinely worried about the village. Victoria pointed out the importance of observing everyone, and Emily brought up Victoria's quietness. I need to make a careful decision.]\n\nBenjamin",
