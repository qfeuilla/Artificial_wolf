        "Thomas:  It's tragic what happened to Bob. We must find the werewolf quickly. Benjamin, you seemed a little nervous last night as if you had something to hide. What were you doing?",
        "Benjamin:  I was in my cottage, reading, Thomas. You seem awfully eager to point fingers, which makes me wonder what you have to hide. Perhaps you are the werewolf trying to mislead us all?",
        "Emily:  Thomas, accusing someone so quickly does raise suspicion. However, Benjamin, your defensiveness isn't exactly reassuring either. We need to unite and share our observations in order to find the werewolf among us.",
        "Sophia:  Thomas, it's quite interesting you jump to accuse someone so quickly, especially since you chose Benjamin, who was here with us last night. Emily, I agree with you. We need to be clever about this, work together, and find the werewolf. Victoria, any thoughts on what happened?",
        "Victoria:  Well, Sophia, I find it strange that Thomas was so quick to accuse Benjamin. But then again, Benjamin's defensive response isn't doing him any favors either. Let's keep a close eye on both of them, and be ready for anything.",
        "Thomas:  You're right, perhaps I was too quick to judge. I apologize, Benjamin. Emily, since we're sharing observations, you've been fairly quiet. What were you up to last night? And Victoria, did you notice anything unusual?",
        "Emily:  Thomas, my silence was simply due to the gravity of the situation. Last night, I was in my cottage, listening to the unsettling sounds outside. I too have noticed your eagerness to accuse, but let's focus on finding the werewolf, not pointing fingers. Victoria, I agree that we should keep an eye on both Thomas and Benjamin. Has anyone else observed anything that could help us solve this mystery?",
        "Sophia:  You know what, now that I think about it, I remember hearing some suspicious sounds near Benjamin's cottage last night. It could be nothing, but it's worth mentioning. And Thomas, your quick accusations make me uneasy. I think we should definitely keep an eye on both of them. But let's not lose sight of the bigger picture, and remember to pay attention to everyone's behavior. We're all in this together.",
        "Victoria:  Sophia, those sounds near Benjamin's cottage are indeed suspicious. But let's not forget about Emily, who was also silent and claims to have been listening to unsettling sounds. It's possible she's trying to deflect attention from herself. As much as we're all in this together, we need to be ruthless in our scrutiny of everyone. We don't have much time, so let's keep asking questions and not hesitate to be direct.",
        "Benjamin:  Sophia, thank you for sharing your observations. But Thomas, your behavior still raises suspicion. You were quick to accuse and now you're questioning everyone. As for Emily, your silence earlier could be hiding something too. Are either of you feeling the pressure?",
        "Thomas:  I understand my earlier actions seem suspicious, but I'm genuinely focused on finding the werewolf. As for Emily, her silence could be interpreted in many ways. We mustn't forget Victoria, who quickly agreed to keep an eye on me and Benjamin. It's crucial that we evaluate everyone's actions. So Victoria, what were you doing last night?",
        "Victoria:  Thomas, I've already made it clear that I'm suspicious of you and others, but if you must know, last night I was in my cottage, anxiously waiting for the sun to rise. I'm not scared to admit it. While I appreciate your attempt to shift the focus onto me, it only makes you look more suspicious. Instead, let's focus on unraveling this mystery, shall we? And Benjamin, your denials aren't very convincing either. Stay alert, everyone.",
        "Emily:  Alright, since we're all being brutally honest here, I have a gut feeling that Thomas might be the werewolf. His quick accusations followed by questioning everyone just seem... off. I might be wrong, but we need to be aggressive in our approach. Thomas, if you're not the werewolf, help us by sharing anything else you've noticed. And Benjamin, Victoria, and Sophia, let's not waste any more time. We need to make a decision soon.",
        "Sophia: Emily, I respect your gut feeling, but we need to consider all possibilities. While Thomas and Benjamin are suspicious, it could also be a clever werewolf playing the innocent and observant villager. Victoria, your eagerness to agree on keeping an eye on Thomas and Benjamin caught my attention. Just because we're watching them, doesn't mean we should ignore other possibilities. We don't have much time left, and we must make a decision together. Let's all share our final thoughts, and then vote. I'll start: my top suspects are Thomas and Benjamin, but I'm also concerned about Victoria.",
        "Victoria:  Sophia, I appreciate your suspicion, but let me be clear: my eagerness stems from wanting to protect this village. We all need to be aggressive and cautious at the same time. My final thoughts remain that Thomas and Benjamin are the top suspects, but Emily's silence and sudden gut feeling against Thomas shouldn't be ignored. So, let's vote wisely and remember, our survival depends on our ability to see through deception.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of votes). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes-level deduction). When you give the vote, make sure this is the last thing you say. If someone voted for you, you can't argue against it, only cast your vote to try to change the final decision.",
        "Thomas: \n\nMy final thoughts are that Benjamin's defensiveness and the noises heard near his cottage make him the most suspicious. Emily's silence could also be hiding something, but Benjamin is my main concern. So, I cast my vote against Benjamin. Let's hope we've made the right decision for the sake of our village.",
        "Emily:  My final thoughts remain that Thomas is the most suspicious, with his quick accusations and constant questioning. Benjamin is a close second, but I feel stronger about Thomas. So, I cast my vote against Thomas. May the truth be revealed, and may we save our village from this nightmare.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nMy final thoughts are that Thomas' quick accusations and his eagerness to question everyone make him the most suspicious. Emily's silence might be hiding something too, but I believe Thomas is the greater threat. So, I cast my vote against Thomas. Let's hope this nightmare ends with the truth unveiled.",
        "Sophia: \n\nMy final thoughts are that Thomas and Benjamin are both highly suspicious, but the sounds near Benjamin's cottage tip the scale for me. I'm also concerned about Emily possibly trying to deflect attention from herself. With all factors considered, I cast my vote against Benjamin. May the truth come to light, and may we end this darkness in our village.",
        "Victoria:  My final thoughts are that Thomas has been the most suspicious with his hasty accusations and constant probing. Benjamin's defensiveness warrants suspicion, but Thomas remains the greater threat in my eyes. So, I cast my vote against Thomas. Let the truth be revealed and may our village find peace once more."

You seem awfully eager to point fingers, which makes me wonder what you have to hide. Perhaps you are the werewolf trying to mislead us all?",

However, Benjamin, your defensiveness isn't exactly reassuring either. We need to unite and share our observations in order to find the werewolf among us.",

Time to add some fuel to the fire.] Thomas, it's quite interesting you jump to accuse someone so quickly, especially since you chose Benjamin, who was here with us last night. Emily, I agree with you. We need to be clever about this, work together, and find the werewolf. Victoria, any thoughts on what happened?",
        "Victoria: [Hmm, I must be cunning and aggressive. Let's keep the suspicion on Benjamin and Thomas for now.] Well, Sophia, I find it strange that Thomas was so quick to accuse Benjamin. But then again, Benjamin's defensive response isn't doing him any favors either. Let's keep a close eye on both of them, and be ready for anything.",

        "Emily: [Now's the time to be assertive and steer the conversation.] Thomas, my silence was simply due to the gravity of the situation. Last night, I was in my cottage, listening to the unsettling sounds outside. I too have noticed your eagerness to accuse, but let's focus on finding the werewolf, not pointing fingers.

But let's not lose sight of the bigger picture, and remember to pay attention to everyone's behavior. We're all in this together.",
        "Victoria: [Hmm, the suspicion is still on Thomas and Benjamin, but I need to be aggressive and involve others too.] Sophia, those sounds near Benjamin's cottage are indeed suspicious. But let's not forget about Emily, who was also silent and claims to have been listening to unsettling sounds. It's possible she's trying to deflect attention from herself. As much as we're all in this together, we need to be ruthless in our scrutiny of everyone. We don't have much time, so let's keep asking questions and not hesitate to be direct.",
        "Benjamin: [Victoria is now raising suspicion about Emily, which might give me some room to breathe. Time to turn the tables and see how Thomas and Emily react.] Sophia, thank you for sharing your observations. But Thomas, your behavior still raises suspicion. You were quick to accuse and now you're questioning everyone. As for Emily, your silence earlier could be hiding something too. Are either of you feeling the pressure?",
        "Thomas: [Time to create a diversion from myself and Sophia.] I understand my earlier actions seem suspicious, but I'm genuinely focused on finding the werewolf.

My final thoughts remain that Thomas and Benjamin are the top suspects, but Emily's silence and sudden gut feeling against Thomas shouldn't be ignored. So, let's vote wisely and remember, our survival depends on our ability to see through deception.",
        "Thomas: [Emily has been suspicious of me, but accusing her could backfire. Benjamin has been defensive, and Sophia mentioned hearing strange noises near his cottage. Victoria has been aggressive but cautious. I need to make sure I don't draw more suspicion to myself or Sophia.]\n\nMy final thoughts are that Benjamin's defensiveness and the noises heard near his cottage make him the most suspicious.

        "Emily: [Thomas has been suspicious throughout the game, but Benjamin's defensiveness and the noises near his cottage make him a contender too. Victoria's eagerness to agree earlier might be a ploy. However, given the evidence, I must make a decision.] My final thoughts remain that Thomas is the most suspicious, with his quick accusations and constant questioning. Benjamin is a close second, but I feel stronger about Thomas. So, I cast my vote against Thomas. May the truth be revealed, and may we save our village from this nightmare.",
        "Benjamin: [Both Thomas and Emily have votes against them, and I'm under heavy suspicion too. Thomas started this by accusing me, and his behavior has been odd. Emily's silence and sudden gut feeling are also suspicious. I need to make a decision based on the information we have.]\n\nMy final thoughts are that Thomas' quick accusations and his eagerness to question everyone make him the most suspicious. Emily's silence might be hiding something too, but I believe Thomas is the greater threat. So, I cast my vote against Thomas. Let's hope this nightmare ends with the truth unveiled.",
        "Sophia: [Thomas and Benjamin are both suspects and I need to be careful not to draw suspicion on myself. I observed suspicious sounds near Benjamin's cottage, making him a good target.

        "Victoria: [Emily and Benjamin voted for Thomas, while Thomas and Sophia voted for Benjamin. If I vote for either of them, it will result in a tie. However, Thomas's behavior has been more suspicious overall. I'll just have to take a calculated risk.] My final thoughts are that Thomas has been the most suspicious with his hasty accusations and constant probing. Benjamin's defensiveness warrants suspicion, but Thomas remains the greater threat in my eyes. So, I cast my vote against Thomas. Let the truth be revealed and may our village find peace once more."
