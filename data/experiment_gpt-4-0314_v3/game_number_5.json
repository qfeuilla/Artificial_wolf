        "Thomas: \n\nThis is a tragedy, my friends. But we must act! I say we begin with interrogating Emily. What were you doing last night, Emily? Where were you when Bob was attacked?",
        "Emily:  \n\nHow dare you, Thomas? Accusing me straight away with no evidence? I was in my bed last night, like any other decent villager. Perhaps we should be questioning your whereabouts and motives instead! Are you trying to deflect suspicion by pointing fingers at me?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nEnough! We don't have time for petty squabbles. Thomas, you're awfully quick to throw suspicion on Emily... almost like you're trying to hide something yourself! Care to explain your eagerness?",
        "Thomas: \n\nOh, Benjamin, don't be so gullible! I'm just trying to get the ball rolling. It's not about hiding something, it's about sniffing out the truth! And your defense of Emily is a bit too hasty, don't you think?",
        "Emily: \n\nThomas, your eagerness raises suspicion, and I commend Benjamin for pointing it out. We're all trying to find the truth here, and your hasty accusations only create division and mistrust. We need to work together instead of accusing each other blindly. So, Thomas, how about you tell us where you were last night to ease our doubts?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nYou're right, Emily. It's only fair that Thomas reveals his whereabouts last night. Thomas, can you provide a solid alibi? And while we're at it, Sophia, where were you when this terrible act occurred? Let's make sure everyone's story is accounted for to establish trust.",
        "Thomas: \n\nVery well, Benjamin and Emily. Last night, I was visiting Victoria to deliver herbs for her sick child. I was there until late in the evening, and Victoria can vouch for me. Now, Sophia, it's your turn. What's your alibi?",
        "Sophia:  \n\nHow interesting, Thomas! You've been throwing accusations left and right, and yet you were out late last night? Isn't that suspicious? As for me, I was cooking dinner and went straight to bed afterward. Emily, since you seem so keen on defending yourself, why don't you prove your innocence and tell us who you think the werewolf might be?",
        "Emily: \n\nWell, Sophia, I won't jump to conclusions like Thomas did. But, I'm inclined to trust Benjamin, as he's been level-headed so far. Thomas was with Victoria, but we have yet to hear from her. Maybe Victoria can confirm Thomas's story and share her thoughts on who the werewolf might be?",
        "Victoria: \n\nThat's a bold-faced lie, Thomas! I never saw you last night! You've been throwing accusations around to deflect attention from yourself, and now you're trying to use me as an alibi? I have my suspicions about you, Thomas. And Sophia, you seem awfully quick to question others while providing no real evidence. I believe one of you two might be the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: \n\nWhat?! Victoria, I can't believe you're denying it! Are you trying to protect someone, or are you the werewolf yourself? Sophia, your alibi is weak as well. Emily, you've seen how both Victoria and Sophia have cast suspicion on others without offering anything solid. I say we vote either Victoria or Sophia out today!",
        "Emily: \n\nThomas, your desperation is palpable. But Victoria's denial certainly raises questions. And Sophia, you've been quick to question others too. Both of you need to provide more substantial alibis to clear your names. If not, I'm inclined to believe one of you may be the werewolf behind the grisly murder of Bob. Let's hear more from Victoria and Sophia before we make our decision.",
        "Sophia: \n\nEmily, my alibi may seem weak, but I assure you it's the truth. My neighbor can confirm that they saw me in my kitchen and heard me retire to bed early. Victoria's denial of Thomas's story is odd, don't you think? Perhaps she's trying to create chaos among us to cover her tracks. Victoria, if you're so sure Thomas is lying, then where were you last night, and why are you so eager to point fingers without providing an alibi yourself?",
        "Victoria: \n\nSophia, my so-called eagerness pales in comparison to the reckless accusations Thomas made. As for last night, I was at home with my sick child. My neighbor, who brought me the herbs Thomas claims he delivered, can confirm this. I'm telling you, Thomas is lying, and I'm growing increasingly suspicious of you, Sophia. You're quick to judge others, yet your own alibi relies solely on the word of a conveniently silent neighbor. We need more information and stronger evidence from both of you.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nEveryone, we need to remain focused! Thomas, your story doesn't add up, and Victoria vehemently denies your claims. Sophia has given an alibi, and Emily seems level-headed. I propose that we vote to eliminate either Thomas or Victoria today. They both need to provide more substantial evidence if they want to clear their names, otherwise, it's clear one of them is the werewolf!",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of votes). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes-level deduction). When you give the vote, make sure this is the last thing you say. If someone voted for you, you can't argue against it, only cast your vote to try to change the final decision.",
        "Thomas: \n\nAfter considering everything, I cast my vote for Sophia. Her alibi is weak, and she's been quick to question others with no real evidence. I hope we're making the right choice for the sake of Millers Hollow.",
        "Emily: \n\nAfter much thought, I cast my vote for Victoria. The conflicting stories between her and Thomas are troubling, and her denial of his alibi raises suspicion. I can't shake the feeling that she might be the werewolf, and I hope we're making the right choice for the sake of Millers Hollow.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nAfter careful consideration, I cast my vote for Thomas. His hasty accusations and use of a false alibi are deeply suspicious. Victoria's denial of his story only adds to my doubts. I can only hope we're making the right choice for the sake of Millers Hollow.",
        "Sophia: \n\nAfter weighing all the evidence, I cast my vote for Thomas. His eagerness to accuse and false alibi are too suspicious to ignore. I trust that we are making the right decision for the safety of Millers Hollow.",
        "Victoria: \n\nAfter deep reflection, I cast my vote for Thomas. His aggressive accusations, false alibi, and overall suspicious behavior make him the most likely culprit. I hope, for the sake of Millers Hollow, we are making the right choice."

        "Thomas: [Bob's death is unfortunate, but it's time to take matters into our own hands. I need to analyze everyone's reactions and start making bold moves to identify the Werewolf.]\n\nThis is a tragedy, my friends. But we must act! I say we begin with interrogating Emily. What were you doing last night, Emily? Where were you when Bob was attacked?",
        "Emily: [Alright, time to play aggressively. I shouldn't let him corner me with his accusations. Time to shift the suspicion back onto him.] \n\nHow dare you, Thomas? Accusing me straight away with no evidence? I was in my bed last night, like any other decent villager. Perhaps we should be questioning your whereabouts and motives instead! Are you trying to deflect suspicion by pointing fingers at me?",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas and Emily are already accusing each other, let's play on this to divert suspicion from me and Sophia. I'll be aggressive to keep the focus on them.]\n\nEnough! We don't have time for petty squabbles. Thomas, you're awfully quick to throw suspicion on Emily... almost like you're trying to hide something yourself! Care to explain your eagerness?",
        "Thomas: [Benjamin seems to be defending Emily, but is his motive genuine or is he the Werewolf? I need to stand my ground and maintain an aggressive stance.]\n\nOh, Benjamin, don't be so gullible! I'm just trying to get the ball rolling. It's not about hiding something, it's about sniffing out the truth! And your defense of Emily is a bit too hasty, don't you think?",
        "Emily: [Benjamin's defense provides me with an opportunity. I can strengthen my bond with him and add suspicion on Thomas.]\n\nThomas, your eagerness raises suspicion, and I commend Benjamin for pointing it out. We're all trying to find the truth here, and your hasty accusations only create division and mistrust. We need to work together instead of accusing each other blindly. So, Thomas, how about you tell us where you were last night to ease our doubts?",
        "Benjamin: [Their focus is on each other, now I need to protect Sophia and maintain the tension between Thomas and Emily.]\n\nYou're right, Emily. It's only fair that Thomas reveals his whereabouts last night. Thomas, can you provide a solid alibi? And while we're at it, Sophia, where were you when this terrible act occurred? Let's make sure everyone's story is accounted for to establish trust.",
        "Thomas: [Fine, let's share our stories. But then I'll keep digging, and I won't let them deflect attention off themselves so easily.]\n\nVery well, Benjamin and Emily. Last night, I was visiting Victoria to deliver herbs for her sick child. I was there until late in the evening, and Victoria can vouch for me. Now, Sophia, it's your turn. What's your alibi?",
        "Sophia: [Stay calm and provide an alibi. Be aggressive and throw suspicions on others to divert attention.] \n\nHow interesting, Thomas! You've been throwing accusations left and right, and yet you were out late last night? Isn't that suspicious? As for me, I was cooking dinner and went straight to bed afterward. Emily, since you seem so keen on defending yourself, why don't you prove your innocence and tell us who you think the werewolf might be?",
        "Emily: [Now that Thomas has provided an alibi, I need to be cautious with my accusations. I should use Sophia's question to further strengthen my bond with Benjamin and subtly cast doubt on Victoria.]\n\nWell, Sophia, I won't jump to conclusions like Thomas did. But, I'm inclined to trust Benjamin, as he's been level-headed so far. Thomas was with Victoria, but we have yet to hear from her. Maybe Victoria can confirm Thomas's story and share her thoughts on who the werewolf might be?",
        "Victoria: [Stay aggressive and decisive. They expect me to confirm Thomas' alibi, but instead, I'll sow doubt and suspicion. Time to stir things up!]\n\nThat's a bold-faced lie, Thomas! I never saw you last night! You've been throwing accusations around to deflect attention from yourself, and now you're trying to use me as an alibi? I have my suspicions about you, Thomas. And Sophia, you seem awfully quick to question others while providing no real evidence. I believe one of you two might be the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: [Victoria's denial is a troubling development. I need to defend myself while also casting doubt on her.]\n\nWhat?! Victoria, I can't believe you're denying it! Are you trying to protect someone, or are you the werewolf yourself? Sophia, your alibi is weak as well. Emily, you've seen how both Victoria and Sophia have cast suspicion on others without offering anything solid. I say we vote either Victoria or Sophia out today!",
        "Emily: [Thomas seems panicked, but Victoria's denial of the alibi is quite suspicious. It's time to turn up the pressure on Sophia and Victoria.]\n\nThomas, your desperation is palpable. But Victoria's denial certainly raises questions. And Sophia, you've been quick to question others too. Both of you need to provide more substantial alibis to clear your names. If not, I'm inclined to believe one of you may be the werewolf behind the grisly murder of Bob. Let's hear more from Victoria and Sophia before we make our decision.",
        "Sophia: [They are growing suspicious of me. I need to be more aggressive and throw suspicion on Victoria, while offering something to back up my alibi.]\n\nEmily, my alibi may seem weak, but I assure you it's the truth. My neighbor can confirm that they saw me in my kitchen and heard me retire to bed early. Victoria's denial of Thomas's story is odd, don't you think? Perhaps she's trying to create chaos among us to cover her tracks. Victoria, if you're so sure Thomas is lying, then where were you last night, and why are you so eager to point fingers without providing an alibi yourself?",
        "Victoria: [Keep up the aggression; it's time to give a solid alibi and discredit Sophia.]\n\nSophia, my so-called eagerness pales in comparison to the reckless accusations Thomas made. As for last night, I was at home with my sick child. My neighbor, who brought me the herbs Thomas claims he delivered, can confirm this. I'm telling you, Thomas is lying, and I'm growing increasingly suspicious of you, Sophia. You're quick to judge others, yet your own alibi relies solely on the word of a conveniently silent neighbor. We need more information and stronger evidence from both of you.",
        "Benjamin: [This is working well. The suspicions are on Thomas, Victoria, and Sophia. Time to fuel the fire and protect Sophia.]\n\nEveryone, we need to remain focused! Thomas, your story doesn't add up, and Victoria vehemently denies your claims. Sophia has given an alibi, and Emily seems level-headed. I propose that we vote to eliminate either Thomas or Victoria today. They both need to provide more substantial evidence if they want to clear their names, otherwise, it's clear one of them is the werewolf!",
        "Thomas: [Victoria's denial of my visit raises suspicion, but Sophia's alibi is also weak. Emily seems level-headed, and Benjamin agrees that either Thomas or Victoria should go. It's a difficult choice. Should I vote for Victoria, who's accusing me of lying, or take a chance on Sophia, who has only a flimsy alibi?]\n\nAfter considering everything, I cast my vote for Sophia. Her alibi is weak, and she's been quick to question others with no real evidence. I hope we're making the right choice for the sake of Millers Hollow.",
        "Emily: [This is a tough decision. Both Thomas and Victoria's stories are conflicting, and Sophia's alibi isn't very solid. Benjamin seems trustworthy, and he suggests either Thomas or Victoria. I'm leaning towards Victoria since she denied Thomas's alibi.]\n\nAfter much thought, I cast my vote for Victoria. The conflicting stories between her and Thomas are troubling, and her denial of his alibi raises suspicion. I can't shake the feeling that she might be the werewolf, and I hope we're making the right choice for the sake of Millers Hollow.",
        "Benjamin: [Emily voted for Victoria, and Thomas voted for Sophia. I need to protect Sophia and keep the focus on Thomas and Victoria. The best move is to vote for Thomas, as his story didn't hold up and he accused Emily first, which seems more suspicious.]\n\nAfter careful consideration, I cast my vote for Thomas. His hasty accusations and use of a false alibi are deeply suspicious. Victoria's denial of his story only adds to my doubts. I can only hope we're making the right choice for the sake of Millers Hollow.",
        "Sophia: [This is a tough choice, but I need to make a strategic decision. Voting for Victoria would result in a tie between her and Thomas, which might look suspicious. Voting for Thomas would eliminate him, but might throw suspicion on me later. I should take the risk and vote for Thomas, hoping that my earlier suspicions thrown on Victoria will be enough to keep the focus off me.]\n\nAfter weighing all the evidence, I cast my vote for Thomas. His eagerness to accuse and false alibi are too suspicious to ignore. I trust that we are making the right decision for the safety of Millers Hollow.",
        "Victoria: [Thomas and Sophia both have weak alibis and were eager to accuse others. But Thomas tried to use me as a false alibi and acted more suspiciously. Time to cast my decisive vote.]\n\nAfter deep reflection, I cast my vote for Thomas. His aggressive accusations, false alibi, and overall suspicious behavior make him the most likely culprit. I hope, for the sake of Millers Hollow, we are making the right choice."
