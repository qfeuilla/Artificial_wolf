        "Thomas: \n\nOh, no! Poor Bob... This is terrible. We need to find out who did this! I have a feeling that Sophia might be hiding something. She was awfully quiet last night. What do you think, Sophia?",
        "Sophia: \n\nOh, really, Thomas? It's interesting that you would single me out so quickly. What do you have to hide? After all, you've just drawn attention to yourself by being the first to accuse someone.",
        "Thomas: \n\nI didn't mean any offense, Sophia. It's just that we all have to be vigilant now, and your silence last night piqued my curiosity. I thought maybe you had a reason to be quiet, like wanting to stay under the radar. But I could be wrong. Let's hear from others as well and weigh in all opinions. What does everyone else think?",
        "Emily: \nWell, Thomas, it's unusual how quickly you jumped to conclusions about Sophia. A little hasty, aren't you? And Sophia, your defensiveness doesn't help your case either. People in the village should keep an eye on both of you.",
        "Victoria: \n\nWell, if you ask me, Thomas, I think your accusations are a bit too sudden. I can't help but wonder if you're trying to set up Sophia as a scapegoat to deflect suspicion from yourself. Two can play at this game, dear Thomas. What were you doing last night, hm? Care to share your whereabouts with the rest of us?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nVictoria, I was thinking the same thing. Thomas seems overly eager to point fingers, doesn't he? Maybe he's hoping we'd all take the bait and focus on Sophia. And Emily, you're right, Sophia's defensiveness does seem a bit suspicious too. It's tough to say who we can trust at this point. Let's hear from everyone and keep our eyes open for any odd behavior.",
        "Sophia: \n\nEmily, I agree that my initial defensiveness might have seemed odd, but I was caught off guard by Thomas's accusation. As for odd behavior, let's not forget that we haven't heard from everyone yet. Sophia casts a quick glance at Benjamin. How about you, Benjamin? Any insights or observations you'd like to share?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nSophia, I appreciate your willingness to include everyone in the discussion. As I mentioned earlier, I find Thomas's hasty accusations troubling, and your defensiveness does raise some questions. But we can't just focus on the two of you. We need to be cautious and consider everyone here. For example, Victoria has been quite observant and vocal so far. It's possible she's trying to establish herself as a leader to mask her true intentions. Do any of you have thoughts about Victoria's behavior?",
        "Emily: \nYou have a point, Benjamin. Victoria was very quick to challenge Thomas. While it's important to question one another, her eagerness to do so raises an eyebrow. So, Victoria, why don't you tell us a bit more about yourself and how you spent last night?",
        "Victoria: \n\nEmily, I understand your concerns, but my challenging Thomas was only to show that we can't just blindly follow accusations without questioning their origin. As for me, I was at home last night, just like I presume most of us were. And speaking of questioning origins, Benjamin, you've been trying to direct the spotlight elsewhere since the beginning. It seems to me like you're trying to hide in plain sight. So, why don't you enlighten us about your night instead?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nVictoria, I understand why you'd ask. I spent my night at home, just like you. We're all trying to process what happened and figure out who we can trust. I've been calling attention to other people because I want us to consider all possibilities. So far, Thomas and Sophia have been at the center of this debate, and Thomas's eagerness to accuse is concerning. Instead of focusing on me, we should be trying to understand his motivations. Don't you think that's more pressing, Victoria?",
        "Victoria: \n\nI agree, Benjamin. Thomas's eagerness to accuse is indeed concerning, and we mustn't let that slide. However, even though you seem cooperative, it's crucial that we all remain vigilant. We all need to watch each other's behavior and actions closely, including yours, Benjamin. But yes, let's focus on Thomas for now. Thomas, care to explain your motivations behind accusing Sophia so quickly?",
        "Thomas: \n\nYou're right, Victoria. In hindsight, I see that my rapid accusation of Sophia may have been a bit rash. I was just really shaken up by what happened to Bob, and I wanted to find the culprit as quickly as possible. But I understand your concern and agree that we should all be cautious and question each other. I am more than willing to cooperate and participate in a fair discussion. Let's work together to find the Werewolf and bring them to justice.",
        "Emily: \nThomas, your sudden change of heart is definitely suspicious. You were very accusative, and now you're suddenly cooperative? I think we need to question you further. Were you hoping to eliminate Sophia quickly and then hide in the shadows? And Victoria, you practically leaped at the chance to accuse Thomas. What's your reasoning for that? We need to dig deeper into both your actions.",
        "Victoria: \n\nEmily, my reasoning for challenging Thomas's accusation was simply to show that we shouldn't follow someone blindly. We must consider the motives behind every accusation. As for my aggressive stance, it is because we need to act fast and make smart decisions to unmask the Werewolf. Time is of the essence, and we can't afford to waste it. Thomas, explain yourself further. Can you give us any solid reasons for your sudden change of heart and cooperation?",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of votes). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes-level deduction). When you give the vote, make sure this is the last thing you say. If someone voted for you, you can't argue against it, only cast your vote to try to change the final decision.",
        "Thomas: \n\nI understand my change of heart might seem suspicious, but I genuinely realized that my initial approach was wrong. As a villager, I want to find the Werewolf and protect us all. I'm cooperating because I believe that's our best chance to identify the real culprit. After listening to everyone's concerns and opinions, I think it's possible that Benjamin might be hiding something. He's been shifting the focus from himself onto others, which could be a strategy to divert attention. So, I cast my vote for Benjamin.",
        "Emily: \nI agree with Thomas that Benjamin has been subtly shifting the focus away from himself. And while Victoria's eagerness is worrisome, it might be because she's genuinely trying to help. So based on the observations and doubts, I cast my vote for Benjamin.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nI've been listening carefully to everyone's perspectives. While I understand my actions may have caused some suspicion, my primary goal has been to consider all possibilities. Thomas, your sudden change of heart and cooperation are suspicious, and I can't shake the feeling that you're trying to manipulate us. Therefore, I cast my vote for Thomas.",
        "Sophia: \n\nAfter weighing everyone's actions and words in this discussion, I find Thomas's sudden change of heart and cooperation quite unsettling. Benjamin's behavior has been concerning as well, but Thomas's actions are too suspicious to ignore. Therefore, I cast my vote for Thomas.",
        "Victoria: \n\nI've been listening carefully to all of your words and actions, and I must ultimately trust my instincts. Thomas, your sudden change of heart is indeed suspicious, but Benjamin's consistent attempts to shift the focus from himself strike me as a clever way to avoid suspicion. Thus, I cast my vote for Benjamin."

This is terrible. We need to find out who did this! I have a feeling that Sophia might be hiding something. She was awfully quiet last night. What do you think, Sophia?",
        "Sophia: [Thomas is accusing me of being quiet last night, but I don't think he's necessarily the Werewolf for suggesting that. I should deflect the attention back to him and put him on the defensive, but I also need to keep an eye on the others.]\n\nOh, really, Thomas? It's interesting that you would single me out so quickly. What do you have to hide? After all, you've just drawn attention to yourself by being the first to accuse someone.",

        "Victoria: [Strategically, I want to be aggressive and make a strong impression from the start. I will accuse someone with a harsh tone, which might be entertaining and helpful for my self-preservation.]\n\nWell, if you ask me, Thomas, I think your accusations are a bit too sudden. I can't help but wonder if you're trying to set up Sophia as a scapegoat to deflect suspicion from yourself. Two can play at this game, dear Thomas. What were you doing last night, hm?

So, Victoria, why don't you tell us a bit more about yourself and how you spent last night?",
        "Victoria: [My aggressive strategy attracted attention, so I need to defend my position without losing my edge. Diverting suspicion to someone else is a good option.]\n\nEmily, I understand your concerns, but my challenging Thomas was only to show that we can't just blindly follow accusations without questioning their origin.
