        "Thomas: \n\nThis is terrible news, but we must act quickly! I have reason to suspect Emily. Emily, can you provide a solid alibi for last night?",
        "Emily: \nOh, Thomas! Already accusing me? What a way to start a conversation. I never thought you'd be the one to jump to conclusions so quickly. Is it to hide something, perhaps? I was at home, all night, minding my own business. But what about you? Where were you?",
        "Thomas: \n\nEmily, I'm only trying to keep us all safe. It's important to ask tough questions. I was also at home, and I can assure you I have no ill intentions. But our main focus should be finding the Werewolf. What about Victoria? She's been rather quiet so far. Speak up, Victoria, we need to hear from everyone!",
        "Victoria: \n\nThomas, I find it rather convenient that you're so eager to point fingers but get defensive when someone questions you. Just because I'm quiet doesn't mean I'm guilty. Perhaps it's you who should explain why you're so desperate to accuse others! I was at home last night, like everyone else here. But now that you mention it, Thomas, your constant accusations make you seem quite suspicious.",
        "Emily: \n\nIndeed, Victoria's silence was a bit unsettling. But Thomas, you too are acting far too rushed in your judgments. It's only the first day, and we need to be careful with our decisions. By the way, Victoria, if you were at home, why didn't anyone see you? You both need to answer some questions if you want to clear your names.",
        "Thomas: \n\nI hear your concerns, Emily and Victoria. I might be overzealous, but that's only because I want to protect our village. Benjamin and Sophia have been awfully quiet as well. What were the two of you doing last night? We need a full picture if we're going to find the Werewolf among us.",
        "Benjamin:  That's a bit rich coming from you, Thomas, jumping on everyone like a rabid dog. As for me, I was at home last night, and I've got nothing to hide. Maybe if you'd stop barking orders for a moment, we could get a better handle on the situation. Sophia, what's your story?",
        "Sophia:  Benjamin, just because I haven't spoken yet doesn't make me guilty. I spent the night at home, but I'm more interested in discussing the fact that Thomas is accusing everyone left and right. Seems like a convenient diversion for a werewolf, don't you think? Emily, Victoria, what do you make of this? Do you think Thomas is guilty?",
        "Victoria: \n\nSophia, I completely agree with you. Thomas' aggressive accusations do seem like a diversion tactic. Emily, as you said earlier, it's only the first day, and we need to be cautious. However, I can't help but feel suspicious of Thomas. He's been far too eager to blame others without providing solid evidence. What do you think, Emily? Is Thomas just overzealous, or is there something more sinister behind his behavior?",
        "Emily: \n\nYou're right, Victoria. Thomas' erratic behavior is highly suspicious. We cannot afford to ignore such a blatant attempt at misdirection. Thomas, you've been throwing accusations around with no concrete basis, but can you provide any substantial evidence to back up your claims? If not, I'm afraid the finger of suspicion is pointing firmly at you.",
        "Thomas: \n\nYou all seem quite keen on ganging up on me, and I find that rather suspicious. It's as if you're trying to eliminate someone who's actively seeking the Werewolf. Shouldn't we be focusing on collecting evidence and alibis instead of attacking each other? We need to work together, not let the beast divide us. So, let's hear more about what everyone was doing last night, and any information that might help us determine who the real threat is.",
        "Benjamin:  You're right, Thomas. We've been caught up in accusations, but we need solid evidence to make an informed decision. I still think your behavior is suspicious, but let's move forward and gather more information from everyone. Emily, Victoria, Sophia, any more insights or observations from last night? We need to piece together the puzzle before it's too late.",
        "Emily: \n\nIndeed, Benjamin, we shouldn't allow the Werewolf to divide us. Last night, I heard some strange noises outside my window, but I couldn't identify the source. Victoria, Sophia, did either of you notice anything unusual or out of place last night? We must put our heads together and analyze every detail to catch the Werewolf before more villagers perish. Let's stay vigilant and observant.",
        "Victoria: \n\nActually, now that you mention it, Emily, I did see something quite odd last night. I saw Thomas slipping away into the shadows, and when I tried to call out to him, he didn't respond and disappeared from sight. It's strange behavior, isn't it? Especially considering his eagerness to cast suspicion on others today. Perhaps Thomas' erratic behavior is more than just nerves - maybe he's trying to hide his true identity as the Werewolf. What do you all think of this new piece of information?",
        "Sophia:  I find Victoria's observation incredibly incriminating, Thomas. Your suspicious behavior and the fact that you were seen skulking in the shadows makes it hard for us not to suspect you. If you're not the Werewolf, you better come up with a convincing explanation for your actions. We need to weigh this evidence before making our decision. What do you all think? Emily, Benjamin, any thoughts on this?",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of votes). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes-level deduction). When you give the vote, make sure this is the last thing you say. If someone voted for you, you can't argue against it, only cast your vote to try to change the final decision.",
        "Thomas: \n\nI've considered the evidence and the suspicious behavior exhibited by some of you, and my vote goes to Victoria. Her attempt to accuse me based on seeing me outside at night feels like a diversion to take the focus off her. I believe Victoria is the Werewolf.",
        "Emily: \n\nHaving analyzed all the facts and considering Victoria's observation, I find Thomas' behavior highly suspicious. His eagerness to accuse others, coupled with his strange nocturnal actions, leads me to believe that he is the Werewolf we seek. After careful consideration, I cast my vote for Thomas.",
        "Benjamin:  After much thought, I've weighed the evidence and observed everyone's behavior. Thomas' aggression and the fact that he was seen outside at night is suspicious, but Victoria's sudden accusation feels opportunistic. I can't shake the feeling that there's more to this than meets the eye. So, in an attempt to root out the true Werewolf, I cast my vote for Victoria.",
        "Sophia:  After much deliberation, I find Thomas's aggressive accusations and his actions last night to be the more incriminating evidence. The safety of Millers Hollow is at stake, and we cannot afford to let the Werewolf continue terrorizing our village. With a heavy heart, I cast my vote for Thomas.",
        "Victoria: \n\nTaking into account Emily's and Sophia's observations, I strongly believe Thomas is the Werewolf we're seeking. His aggressive behavior and peculiar actions last night only further reinforce my suspicions. I have no choice but to cast my vote for Thomas, in the hopes of securing the safety of our village."

        "Thomas: [Bob's death is unfortunate, but there's no time to mourn. Time to be aggressive and start putting pressure on the others to reveal their intentions.]\n\nThis is terrible news, but we must act quickly! I have reason to suspect Emily. Emily, can you provide a solid alibi for last night?",
        "Emily: [If I play too defensively, it'll arouse more suspicion. Time to deflect the attention to someone else.]\nOh, Thomas! Already accusing me? What a way to start a conversation. I never thought you'd be the one to jump to conclusions so quickly. Is it to hide something, perhaps? I was at home, all night, minding my own business. But what about you? Where were you?",
        "Thomas: [Interesting that Emily turned the suspicion back to me. I must defend myself while maintaining the pressure on her.]\n\nEmily, I'm only trying to keep us all safe. It's important to ask tough questions. I was also at home, and I can assure you I have no ill intentions. But our main focus should be finding the Werewolf. What about Victoria? She's been rather quiet so far. Speak up, Victoria, we need to hear from everyone!",
        "Victoria: [Think: Emily, my fellow Werewolf, is already under suspicion. I should join the suspicion on Thomas to divert the attention from her.]\n\nThomas, I find it rather convenient that you're so eager to point fingers but get defensive when someone questions you. Just because I'm quiet doesn't mean I'm guilty. Perhaps it's you who should explain why you're so desperate to accuse others! I was at home last night, like everyone else here. But now that you mention it, Thomas, your constant accusations make you seem quite suspicious.",
        "Emily: [Victoria seems like a good target for suspicion. Time to build on that.]\n\nIndeed, Victoria's silence was a bit unsettling. But Thomas, you too are acting far too rushed in your judgments. It's only the first day, and we need to be careful with our decisions. By the way, Victoria, if you were at home, why didn't anyone see you? You both need to answer some questions if you want to clear your names.",
        "Thomas: [Emily and Victoria are both trying to turn the suspicion on me. I need to redirect the focus and get everyone involved in the conversation.]\n\nI hear your concerns, Emily and Victoria. I might be overzealous, but that's only because I want to protect our village. Benjamin and Sophia have been awfully quiet as well. What were the two of you doing last night? We need a full picture if we're going to find the Werewolf among us.",

As for me, I was at home last night, and I've got nothing to hide. Maybe if you'd stop barking orders for a moment, we could get a better handle on the situation. Sophia, what's your story?",
        "Sophia: [This is getting intense. I need to be careful and aggressive in my response.] Benjamin, just because I haven't spoken yet doesn't make me guilty. I spent the night at home, but I'm more interested in discussing the fact that Thomas is accusing everyone left and right. Seems like a convenient diversion for a werewolf, don't you think? Emily, Victoria, what do you make of this? Do you think Thomas is guilty?",
        "Victoria: [Think: Sophia and Benjamin are also questioning Thomas' actions. I can continue to push suspicion onto Thomas to protect Emily and myself.]\n\nSophia, I completely agree with you.

He's been far too eager to blame others without providing solid evidence. What do you think, Emily? Is Thomas just overzealous, or is there something more sinister behind his behavior?",
        "Emily: [This is going exactly as planned. Let's push Thomas further into the spotlight.]\n\nYou're right, Victoria. Thomas' erratic behavior is highly suspicious. We cannot afford to ignore such a blatant attempt at misdirection. Thomas, you've been throwing accusations around with no concrete basis, but can you provide any substantial evidence to back up your claims? If not, I'm afraid the finger of suspicion is pointing firmly at you.",
        "Thomas: [I'm being cornered here. Time to flip the script and put the focus back on them.]\n\nYou all seem quite keen on ganging up on me, and I find that rather suspicious. It's as if you're trying to eliminate someone who's actively seeking the Werewolf. Shouldn't we be focusing on collecting evidence and alibis instead of attacking each other? We need to work together, not let the beast divide us. So, let's hear more about what everyone was doing last night, and any information that might help us determine who the real threat is.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas is either a cunning Werewolf or genuinely concerned for the village. However, we can't let our guard down just yet.] You're right, Thomas. We've been caught up in accusations, but we need solid evidence to make an informed decision. I still think your behavior is suspicious, but let's move forward and gather more information from everyone. Emily, Victoria, Sophia, any more insights or observations from last night? We need to piece together the puzzle before it's too late.",
        "Emily: [Let's change the focus again and gather more information that may come in handy later.]\n\nIndeed, Benjamin, we shouldn't allow the Werewolf to divide us. Last night, I heard some strange noises outside my window, but I couldn't identify the source. Victoria, Sophia, did either of you notice anything unusual or out of place last night? We must put our heads together and analyze every detail to catch the Werewolf before more villagers perish. Let's stay vigilant and observant.",
        "Victoria: [Think: It's now or never. If I can provide a convincing accusation against Thomas, it might protect both Emily and myself for another day.]\n\nActually, now that you mention it, Emily, I did see something quite odd last night. I saw Thomas slipping away into the shadows, and when I tried to call out to him, he didn't respond and disappeared from sight. It's strange behavior, isn't it?

Your suspicious behavior and the fact that you were seen skulking in the shadows makes it hard for us not to suspect you. If you're not the Werewolf, you better come up with a convincing explanation for your actions. We need to weigh this evidence before making our decision. What do you all think? Emily, Benjamin, any thoughts on this?",
        "Thomas: [Let's think this through. Victoria saw me outside last night, which looks suspicious, but her accusation could be a convenient way to shift attention from herself. Emily mentioned hearing strange noises, indicating that she was awake during the night too. Benjamin and Sophia have been relatively quiet but seem eager to put the blame on me. I'm torn between Victoria and Emily, but Victoria's accusation seems more like a setup to scapegoat me.]\n\nI've considered the evidence and the suspicious behavior exhibited by some of you, and my vote goes to Victoria. Her attempt to accuse me based on seeing me outside at night feels like a diversion to take the focus off her. I believe Victoria is the Werewolf.",
        "Emily: [Victoria has been a valuable accomplice in casting suspicion on Thomas, but I need to ensure my own survival. Thomas is already under suspicion, so it's time to shift gears and secure my position.]\n\nHaving analyzed all the facts and considering Victoria's observation, I find Thomas' behavior highly suspicious. His eagerness to accuse others, coupled with his strange nocturnal actions, leads me to believe that he is the Werewolf we seek. After careful consideration, I cast my vote for Thomas.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas' behavior is definitely suspicious, but Victoria's sudden accusation of seeing him outside at night feels quite convenient, too. Sophia's hasty agreement with Victoria is also a bit concerning. This is a difficult decision.] After much thought, I've weighed the evidence and observed everyone's behavior. Thomas' aggression and the fact that he was seen outside at night is suspicious, but Victoria's sudden accusation feels opportunistic. I can't shake the feeling that there's more to this than meets the eye. So, in an attempt to root out the true Werewolf, I cast my vote for Victoria.",
        "Sophia: [Thomas and Victoria have both been accused. Thomas's aggressive behavior and being seen outside at night is suspicious, but Victoria's sudden accusation could be a way to divert attention from herself. I must make a calculated decision based on the evidence and behavior.] After much deliberation, I find Thomas's aggressive accusations and his actions last night to be the more incriminating evidence. The safety of Millers Hollow is at stake, and we cannot afford to let the Werewolf continue terrorizing our village. With a heavy heart, I cast my vote for Thomas.",
        "Victoria: [Think: Even though Benjamin voted for me, I can't afford to lose my fellow Werewolf, Emily. If we both survive, our chances of winning increase. Staying united with Emily and Sophia, my vote is against Thomas.]\n\nTaking into account Emily's and Sophia's observations, I strongly believe Thomas is the Werewolf we're seeking. His aggressive behavior and peculiar actions last night only further reinforce my suspicions. I have no choice but to cast my vote for Thomas, in the hopes of securing the safety of our village."
