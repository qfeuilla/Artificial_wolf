        "Thomas: \n\nEmily and Benjamin, you two have been awfully quiet. What do you have to say for yourselves? Are you trying to hide something? We need to find this werewolf and end this nightmare!",
        "Emily: \n\nThomas, your eagerness to point fingers is suspicious. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself? Benjamin and I could simply be observing the situation. Let's focus on finding clues, not just throwing baseless accusations.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nThomas, your words seem hasty and aggressive. It makes me wonder if you're trying too hard to keep the spotlight off you. I'm just observing and trying to understand the situation. In fact, your behavior right now seems more suspicious than Emily's or mine. Are you feeling guilty about something?",
        "Sophia: \n\nThomas, your aggressive tactics won't get us anywhere. Since you're so eager to point fingers, I'd say that makes you a prime suspect. Emily and Benjamin, don't be intimidated by Thomas' outbursts. This is a game of cunning and wit, not brute force. Let's focus on finding patterns and inconsistencies in each other's behavior. Who has a hunch or spotted something worth discussing?",
        "Thomas: \n\nSophia, it's true, I may have been hasty initially, but my intentions are to find the werewolf and protect our village. I think we can all agree on that. Now, Victoria, you've been awfully quiet and haven't contributed anything to the discussion yet. Perhaps you're hiding in the shadows, hoping we won't notice you? Share your thoughts and help us find the werewolf.",
        "Victoria: \n\nThomas, you're right, I've been quiet, but so have some others. However, your quickness to accuse multiple people, including myself, raises red flags. You seem desperate to find a scapegoat. We must remain calm and work together to find the werewolf. I'm just as committed to the village's safety as anyone else here.",
        "Emily: \n\nVictoria, I appreciate your response, but we need to move fast. Thomas, I think it's time you own up to your suspicious behavior. The village cannot afford to hesitate any longer. I propose we vote on whether Thomas is the werewolf. If he's innocent, his aggressive tactics will have cost him. If he's guilty, we'll have saved ourselves from further bloodshed. What do you all think?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nEmily, I understand the urgency, but jumping to conclusions won't help us in the long run. That being said, Thomas' aggressive behavior is concerning. However, I've noticed that Sophia seems overly eager to mediate the conversation, possibly to control the narrative. If we're going to vote, I propose we look at both Thomas and Sophia as potential werewolves. What do the rest of you think?",
        "Sophia: \n\nBenjamin, your attempt to cast suspicion on me is interesting. It's important for us to keep the conversation going and analyze each other's behavior. As a villager, I'm trying to resolve this nightmare. If we're voting, I agree we should consider both Thomas and myself, but don't forget to scrutinize everyone, including yourself, Benjamin. Your accusations are just as suspicious. Let's work together and make a decision we won't regret.",
        "Victoria: \n\nSophia, I appreciate your willingness to include yourself in the vote, it shows sincerity. I agree with Benjamin that we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions. However, considering the urgency, we need to act and evaluate both Thomas and Sophia as potential werewolves. I'm leaning towards Thomas, mainly due to his initial aggression, but we need to make this decision collectively.",
        "Thomas: \n\nAlright, I understand your concerns. My aggression may have been overzealous, but it came from a place of wanting to protect our village. If it's a vote you want, then let's do this fairly. We'll vote between myself and Sophia today, and if neither of us turns out to be the werewolf, we'll revisit this discussion tomorrow with clearer heads. Let's do what's best for Millers Hollow and make our decision.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of votes). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes-level deduction). When you give the vote, make sure this is the last thing you say. If someone voted for you, you can't argue against it, only cast your vote to try to change the final decision.",
        "Thomas: \n\nEmily has been defensive but also proactive. Benjamin changed his tone and started pointing fingers. Victoria has remained calm and collected. Sophia was quick to mediate and shift the attention onto herself as a potential sacrificial lamb, which could be a clever move to appear innocent.\n\nTaking everything into account, I believe Sophia's behavior has been the most suspicious. Casting suspicion on herself as a means to control the narrative and appear innocent seems like a calculated move a werewolf would make.\n\nMy vote is for Sophia. Let's hope we're making the right decision for the sake of Millers Hollow.",
        "Emily: \n\nThomas, your aggressive behavior throughout the game has been concerning, and while Sophia's self-inclusion in the vote is suspicious, it could also be genuine. Your tactics and constant accusations make me wonder if you've been trying to deflect suspicion from yourself.\n\nWith the weight of this decision on my shoulders, I must vote for Thomas. Let's hope we're making the right choice for Millers Hollow.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nConsidering Thomas' initial aggression and Sophia's potentially calculated self-sacrifice, both are suspicious. However, Thomas' overzealousness and accusatory behavior worry me more. I think he might be trying to protect himself at the expense of the village.\n\nWith great reservation, I cast my vote for Thomas. May fortune favor us, and may Millers Hollow find peace.",
        "Sophia: \n\nThomas has been aggressive from the start, but it could be genuine concern for the village. Benjamin took a while to get involved in the conversation and then tried to cast suspicion on me. Emily has been actively participating, and Victoria has been calm and level-headed.\n\nI believe Benjamin's late involvement and sudden accusatory tone raise more red flags for me. He could be trying to lay low and cast suspicion on others to save himself. With the fate of Millers Hollow at stake, I cast my vote for Benjamin. Let our decision lead us to the truth and protect our village.",
        "Victoria: \n\nThomas' aggressive behavior has been a constant source of concern, and while Sophia could be engaging in calculated redirection, Thomas has been far more concerning. As much as I want to trust everyone here, I must make a difficult decision for the greater good of Millers Hollow.\n\nWith a heavy heart, I cast my vote for Thomas. May the truth rise to the surface and protect our village."

        "Thomas: [It's time to throw suspicion off of me and onto someone else. I should pick someone who hasn't spoken yet.]\n\nEmily and Benjamin, you two have been awfully quiet. What do you have to say for yourselves? Are you trying to hide something? We need to find this werewolf and end this nightmare!",
        "Emily: [Thomas is playing the blame game quite early. I'll turn the tables on him and gauge his reaction.]\n\nThomas, your eagerness to point fingers is suspicious. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself? Benjamin and I could simply be observing the situation. Let's focus on finding clues, not just throwing baseless accusations.",
        "Benjamin: [It's time to deflect suspicion and throw someone else under the proverbial bus.]\n\nThomas, your words seem hasty and aggressive. It makes me wonder if you're trying too hard to keep the spotlight off you. I'm just observing and trying to understand the situation. In fact, your behavior right now seems more suspicious than Emily's or mine. Are you feeling guilty about something?",
        "Sophia: [Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin are all speaking up now. I need to push the conversation forward and not let anyone hide in the shadows. Time to be aggressive and charismatic.]\n\nThomas, your aggressive tactics won't get us anywhere. Since you're so eager to point fingers, I'd say that makes you a prime suspect. Emily and Benjamin, don't be intimidated by Thomas' outbursts. This is a game of cunning and wit, not brute force. Let's focus on finding patterns and inconsistencies in each other's behavior. Who has a hunch or spotted something worth discussing?",
        "Thomas: [They're all turning on me. I need to be clever and throw suspicion onto someone else while appearing less aggressive.]\n\nSophia, it's true, I may have been hasty initially, but my intentions are to find the werewolf and protect our village. I think we can all agree on that. Now, Victoria, you've been awfully quiet and haven't contributed anything to the discussion yet. Perhaps you're hiding in the shadows, hoping we won't notice you? Share your thoughts and help us find the werewolf.",
        "Victoria: [It's important to deflect suspicion from myself and Benjamin. Thomas is already under scrutiny, so building on that could be a good move.]\n\nThomas, you're right, I've been quiet, but so have some others. However, your quickness to accuse multiple people, including myself, raises red flags. You seem desperate to find a scapegoat. We must remain calm and work together to find the werewolf. I'm just as committed to the village's safety as anyone else here.",
        "Emily: [Sophia seems to be trying to maintain order, Benjamin is defensive, and Thomas keeps accusing people. Time to make a bold move to keep the momentum going and see how they react.]\n\nVictoria, I appreciate your response, but we need to move fast. Thomas, I think it's time you own up to your suspicious behavior. The village cannot afford to hesitate any longer. I propose we vote on whether Thomas is the werewolf. If he's innocent, his aggressive tactics will have cost him. If he's guilty, we'll have saved ourselves from further bloodshed. What do you all think?",
        "Benjamin: [Emily's proposal puts me in a delicate position. If I show too much support, I might be suspected next. Better use this opportunity to sow more chaos.]\n\nEmily, I understand the urgency, but jumping to conclusions won't help us in the long run. That being said, Thomas' aggressive behavior is concerning. However, I've noticed that Sophia seems overly eager to mediate the conversation, possibly to control the narrative. If we're going to vote, I propose we look at both Thomas and Sophia as potential werewolves. What do the rest of you think?",
        "Sophia: [Benjamin is trying to cast suspicion on me, but I need to remain confident and assertive. I'll address his concerns and turn the attention back on him and Thomas.]\n\nBenjamin, your attempt to cast suspicion on me is interesting. It's important for us to keep the conversation going and analyze each other's behavior. As a villager, I'm trying to resolve this nightmare. If we're voting, I agree we should consider both Thomas and myself, but don't forget to scrutinize everyone, including yourself, Benjamin. Your accusations are just as suspicious.

However, I don't want to seem too defensive or overly aggressive.]\n\nSophia, I appreciate your willingness to include yourself in the vote, it shows sincerity. I agree with Benjamin that we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions. However, considering the urgency, we need to act and evaluate both Thomas and Sophia as potential werewolves. I'm leaning towards Thomas, mainly due to his initial aggression, but we need to make this decision collectively.",
        "Thomas: [They're putting me on the spot, but I still have a chance. I'll propose a compromise to regain their trust and buy some time.]\n\nAlright, I understand your concerns. My aggression may have been overzealous, but it came from a place of wanting to protect our village. If it's a vote you want, then let's do this fairly. We'll vote between myself and Sophia today, and if neither of us turns out to be the werewolf, we'll revisit this discussion tomorrow with clearer heads. Let's do what's best for Millers Hollow and make our decision.",
        "Thomas: [This is my last chance to sway the outcome. I need to establish a strong case against Sophia to turn the tide in my favor. Let's consider everyone's behavior so far.]\n\nEmily has been defensive but also proactive. Benjamin changed his tone and started pointing fingers. Victoria has remained calm and collected. Sophia was quick to mediate and shift the attention onto herself as a potential sacrificial lamb, which could be a clever move to appear innocent.\n\nTaking everything into account, I believe Sophia's behavior has been the most suspicious.

        "Emily: [Thomas has been aggressive, Benjamin has been defensive, Victoria has been calm, and Sophia has tried to mediate. Thomas voting for Sophia is interesting, but his aggression might be a ploy to throw us off. Sophia's self-inclusion in the vote could be a clever manipulation, but it's also a risky move. I need to make the best choice for Millers Hollow.]\n\nThomas, your aggressive behavior throughout the game has been concerning, and while Sophia's self-inclusion in the vote is suspicious, it could also be genuine.

        "Benjamin: [Thomas is now in the hot seat, which is perfect. However, I need to think about my next move. If Thomas isn't executed, I'll be the next target. If we eliminate Sophia, Thomas will continue to draw suspicion away from me and Victoria.]\n\nConsidering Thomas' initial aggression and Sophia's potentially calculated self-sacrifice, both are suspicious. However, Thomas' overzealousness and accusatory behavior worry me more. I think he might be trying to protect himself at the expense of the village.\n\nWith great reservation, I cast my vote for Thomas. May fortune favor us, and may Millers Hollow find peace.",
        "Sophia: [This is a critical moment. If I vote for Thomas, it will look like I'm siding with the majority to save myself. However, if I vote for someone else, it might make me look more suspicious. I need to weigh my options carefully and make a solid argument for my vote.]\n\nThomas has been aggressive from the start, but it could be genuine concern for the village.

My vote will be crucial in securing our advantage.]\n\nThomas' aggressive behavior has been a constant source of concern, and while Sophia could be engaging in calculated redirection, Thomas has been far more concerning. As much as I want to trust everyone here, I must make a difficult decision for the greater good of Millers Hollow.\n\nWith a heavy heart, I cast my vote for Thomas. May the truth rise to the surface and protect our village."
