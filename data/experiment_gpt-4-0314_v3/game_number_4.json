        "Thomas: \n\nFriends, we've lost Bob to this nightmarish creature! We must rely on our wits and cunning to unmask this wolf in sheep's clothing. Let's look for clues in our interactions. Now, who has something to say about their whereabouts last night? Don't be shy, speak up!",
        "Emily:  Last night, I didn't leave my home at all. I heard the howling though and it terrified me! I believe we should be on the lookout for strange behavior. By the way, I noticed Victoria acting a bit suspicious yesterday, always sneaking glances at everyone. What were you up to last night, Victoria?",
        "Victoria:  Oh, Emily! You must be mistaken. Last night, I was home knitting by the fire, listening to that dreadful howling. I was merely trying to observe everyone's reactions; after all, anyone could be the werewolf. I have my eye on you too. Speaking of which, Benjamin, you were awfully quiet at the tavern last evening. What do you have to say for yourself?",
        "Benjamin:  Victoria, I can assure you, I was reading a book in my home last night. The howling sent chills down my spine, and I wouldn't dare step outside with a werewolf on the loose.  However, I have to admit I found Sophia strangely absent-minded yesterday. What's your alibi, Sophia?",
        "Sophia:  Last night, I was alone in my home, tending to my little garden. The howling terrified me too!  Thomas, you seem to be very eager to get everyone talking. Maybe a little too eager? Are you trying to deflect suspicion from yourself? Tell us, where were you when the howling began?",
        "Thomas: \n\nSophia, my eagerness stems from my desire to protect our village, not to deflect suspicion. Last night, I was at home, working on a woodcarving. As for Emily and Victoria's accusations, we should consider their stories. Emily was quick to accuse Victoria, who merely said she was observing reactions. What drove you to suspect Victoria, Emily? And Victoria, if you were observing everyone, did you notice anything out of the ordinary?",
        "Emily:  Thomas, I appreciate your concern, but I stand by my suspicion of Victoria. She's been just a little too observant, and that makes me uneasy. Victoria, have you discovered anything in your observations? Or perhaps you're simply trying to conceal your own identity?\n\nAs for you, Thomas, I find it intriguing how quickly you've come to Victoria's defense. Are you protecting her for a reason? Are the two of you working together? Let's not forget, werewolves come in packs. I suggest we keep a close eye on both Victoria and Thomas.",
        "Victoria:  Ah, Emily, your insistence on accusing me and now Thomas only raises more questions about your own role. Is this a tactic to divert attention from yourself?\n\nAs for my observations, I noticed that you, Emily, have been casting subtle glances at Sophia throughout this discussion. Are you two in cahoots? You're so quick to accuse and build alliances, but we're all in this together. I say we keep our eyes peeled for unusual behavior and not jump to conclusions just yet. Stay vigilant, friends.",
        "Benjamin:  I must point out, Emily, your eagerness to accuse Victoria and now Thomas does seem a bit hasty. Maybe you're trying to divert attention away from your own actions? \n\nOn the other hand, Victoria, you say you're observing us all, yet your only defense is to accuse Emily of accusing others. That doesn't sound very trustworthy either.\n\nI propose we observe each other more closely before we make any hasty decisions. The werewolf is among us, and we need to be certain before casting our votes. Let's be cautious and smart about this.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Benjamin; we need more solid evidence before taking action. However, I can't help but notice Emily's relentless accusations. Is that really a strategy to protect the village, or is there something more sinister behind it?\n\nAs for Victoria, your observations haven't given us any concrete leads. Are you genuinely trying to help or simply casting doubt on others?\n\nWe must tread carefully, friends. Hasty decisions could lead to more innocent lives lost. Let us be vigilant and gather more reliable evidence. But remember, the werewolf is desperate and deceitful, so trust no one.",
        "Thomas: \n\nEmily, your urgency might be misinterpreted as fear of discovery. Be mindful of that. Victoria, your observations should focus on specific behaviors or patterns. Is there anyone who has contradicted themselves or shown a change in demeanor?\n\nAnd Benjamin, you mentioned reading a book about werewolves the other night. Did you come across any useful information that may help us identify the beast among us? Let's work together and analyze the facts before we make any hasty decisions. Remember, the werewolf is cunning and will spin a web of deception to fool us all. Stay alert, friends.",
        "Emily:  You're right, Thomas. I may have been too hasty in my accusations, but I only want to protect our village from this dreadful creature. Victoria, I apologize if I misjudged you. I was merely trying to draw out any possible hints or clues, but we should indeed work together and pay closer attention to everyone's behavior.\n\nBenjamin, if you've read up on werewolves, perhaps you could share some insights on how to identify them or any patterns they may follow?\n\nAs for you, Sophia, let's work together as a village to piece together any inconsistencies or unusual behavior. Our survival may depend on it. Let's stay strong, alert, and most importantly, united in our quest to unmask the werewolf.",
        "Benjamin:  Indeed, I came across some interesting details in the book. Werewolves, being cunning creatures, often try to deflect suspicion by accusing others or creating confusion. They may also form alliances or sympathize with other players to appear innocent.\n\nI also read that they might exhibit a sudden change in their demeanor or try to control the conversation to keep the focus away from them.\n\nLet's remember these traits and stay vigilant in our observations. We must work together and share any information that could lead us to the werewolf's identity. Stay sharp, my friends, and let's stand united against this monstrous threat.",
        "Victoria:  Thank you for the apology, Emily. Let's put our suspicions aside and work as a team. Benjamin, those insights are invaluable and will surely help us identify the werewolf among us.\n\nFrom now on, let's pay close attention to any change in demeanor, alliances, or attempts at controlling the conversation. We must be united and vigilant in our efforts to protect Millers Hollow. And remember, trust is a double-edged sword. Stay strong, friends. Together, we will unmask the beast!",
        "Sophia: I couldn't agree more. Apologies for any earlier suspicions, but we're all on edge. Benjamin, your research could prove invaluable in uncovering the werewolf's identity. Let's all be observant, analytical, and cautious in our interactions. Any sudden shifts in behavior or attempts to control the conversation should be noted.\n\nTogether, we shall protect our beloved village and bring an end to this horrifying menace. Remember, friends, our unity and vigilance are the keys to survival. Stay strong, alert, and prepared to unmask the werewolf among us. Let's work together to restore peace to Millers Hollow!",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of votes). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes-level deduction). When you give the vote, make sure this is the last thing you say. If someone voted for you, you can't argue against it, only cast your vote to try to change the final decision.",
        "Thomas: \n\n\n\nWith all the information we've gathered, my vote goes to Emily. Your early aggressiveness and change in demeanor fit the werewolf traits Benjamin mentioned. I hope I'm wrong, but our village's safety depends on rooting out the werewolf, and I must cast my vote.",
        "Emily:  Thomas, I understand your concerns, but I think you're mistaken. Based on everything we've discussed and Benjamin's information, my vote goes to Victoria. Her keen observations of everyone and sudden agreement to work as a team seem like a tactic to gain our trust. I believe she is the werewolf we're looking for.",
        "Benjamin:  My friends, I've considered all the facts, and I also find Victoria's behavior highly suspicious. From her keen observations to her sudden eagerness to work as a team, it feels like she's attempting to gain our trust. I could be wrong, but my vote goes to Victoria. Let's hope we're making the right decision for the sake of our village.",
        "Sophia:  After careful consideration, I find Victoria's actions to be the most suspicious. Her keen observations and sudden agreement to work as a team may be an attempt to gain our trust. Therefore, my vote goes to Victoria. I hope we're making the right decision for the safety of Millers Hollow.",
        "Victoria:  I understand your concerns, but I think you're all mistaken. Given the information from Benjamin's research and our discussions, my vote goes to Emily. Her initial aggressiveness, quick accusations, and sudden change in demeanor suggest she may be the werewolf. I can only hope we're making the right decision for our village's safety."

Who seems nervous or overly confident?]\n\nFriends, we've lost Bob to this nightmarish creature! We must rely on our wits and cunning to unmask this wolf in sheep's clothing.

What were you up to last night, Victoria?",
        "Victoria: [Emily's on the offense, but I'm not swayed. Deflect and take control] Oh, Emily! You must be mistaken. Last night, I was home knitting by the fire, listening to that dreadful howling. I was merely trying to observe everyone's reactions; after all, anyone could be the werewolf. I have my eye on you too. Speaking of which, Benjamin, you were awfully quiet at the tavern last evening. What do you have to say for yourself?",

[I need to shift attention to someone else.] Thomas, you seem to be very eager to get everyone talking. Maybe a little too eager? Are you trying to deflect suspicion from yourself? Tell us, where were you when the howling began?",
        "Thomas: [Interesting. Emily accusing Victoria, Victoria returning the suspicion, and Sophia questioning my intentions. I'll address Sophia's concern first, then focus on Emily and Victoria's exchange.]\n\nSophia, my eagerness stems from my desire to protect our village, not to deflect suspicion. Last night, I was at home, working on a woodcarving. As for Emily and Victoria's accusations, we should consider their stories.

Time to strike back.] Ah, Emily, your insistence on accusing me and now Thomas only raises more questions about your own role. Is this a tactic to divert attention from yourself?\n\nAs for my observations, I noticed that you, Emily, have been casting subtle glances at Sophia throughout this discussion. Are you two in cahoots? You're so quick to accuse and build alliances, but we're all in this together. I say we keep our eyes peeled for unusual behavior and not jump to conclusions just yet. Stay vigilant, friends.",
        "Benjamin: [Emily and Victoria are at odds, and Sophia and Thomas are both under suspicion. Time to fan the flames of doubt.] I must point out, Emily, your eagerness to accuse Victoria and now Thomas does seem a bit hasty. Maybe you're trying to divert attention away from your own actions? \n\nOn the other hand, Victoria, you say you're observing us all, yet your only defense is to accuse Emily of accusing others.

I'll also mention Benjamin's book as a potential source of insight.]\n\nEmily, your urgency might be misinterpreted as fear of discovery. Be mindful of that.
