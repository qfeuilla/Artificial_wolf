        "Thomas: This is unfortunate, I liked him. We don't have a lot to go on. I did hear some noicse on Benjamin side, but maybe it was nothing.",
        "Benjamin:  Thomas, it's strange that you're so quick to point fingers. I heard some rustling near you last night, too. Perhaps it was you who made the noise. Were you visiting poor Bob?",
        "Emily:  Thomas, you're awfully keen on accusing people already. As for you, Benjamin, are you sure it's wise to start making accusations so early? Maybe we should look for other signs, we can't just rely on noises we heard.",
        "Sophia:  Indeed, Benjamin, like Emily said, it's a bit hasty to blame someone right away.  Oh sorry, I forgot, only \"werewolves\" can hear noises at night.  And Thomas, you're eager to find a culprit, aren't you? A little too eager, maybe?",
        "Benjamin:  Emily, Sophia, waiting too long could cost more innocent lives. We must act quickly, and our only leads are the noises we heard. Thomas was quick to accuse me, but his eagerness raises suspicion. I'm not saying he's definitely the Werewolf, but we can't afford to tiptoe around the issue.",
        "Thomas: Ok wait guys. I was just trying to get the conversation starting. I wasn't even trying to point fingers, I said \"maybe it was nothing\". This seem like a really big over-reaction to what I said. If Benjamin was a peasant, he would have probably took this accusation better, it looks like a werewolf-like answer (which I was trying to see if I was going to get).",
        "Emily:  Thomas, I understand you wanted to get the conversation started, but accusing people right off the bat is a risky move. Let's not throw around baseless accusations. We need to think carefully and analyze everyone's behavior. Keep in mind, we all must work together to find the Werewolf, so let's not get too carried away with our suspicions.",
        "Sophia:  Thomas, though you may have wanted to start a conversation, you've created more chaos.  Emily is right; calm down and let's think logically.  Benjamin, you're so concerned about acting quickly, but maybe you're just scared of being discovered. Are you hiding something?",
        "Benjamin:  Sophia, isn't it a bit suspicious that you're so protective of Thomas? You've been quick to defend him and caution against accusations. We all need to analyze each other's behavior, including yours. Are you working together with Thomas to deflect suspicion? Perhaps you're trying to protect a fellow Werewolf?",
        "Thomas: Oh waw such a big speach *clap* *clap* why are you so aggressive Benjamin. Sophia I agree with your deduction, Benjamin is suspicious. At first I didn't have any suspicions but take your time and think. He is obviously hiding something.",
        "Emily:  Hold on everyone, getting aggressive with one another won't help. Benjamin, your concern is valid, but it's too early to tell if Sophia and Thomas are working together. Thomas, you're right that we should think more and analyze everyone's behavior. We just lost Bob, and we need to focus on finding the Werewolf before another innocent life is taken. Let's stay focused and try to gather more information about each other's actions.",
        "Sophia:  Well said, Emily. We need to stay focused. Benjamin, your eagerness to accuse only raises more suspicion.  Funny how you're so good at pointing out how others might be working together.  Maybe your quick accusations are a way to deflect attention from your own guilt. Don't you think?",
        "Benjamin:  Look, accusing me without any evidence is just as baseless as you claim my suspicions are. I'm only pointing out what I see, and frankly, I'm worried for our village. We don't have the luxury of time to gather \"more information.\" We need to act, and we need to act now. It's a simple fact: one of us is the Werewolf, and the rest of us are in danger. Let's stop bickering and focus on finding the real threat.",
        "Thomas: Hmm, strange, are you trying to deflect the convesation to someone else? You know that there is two werewolves left, not just one. I am not afraid of saying it, we are in bad shape and the current decision is decisive let's not make the wrong choice. Maybe we should also keep an eye on who come to Benjamin's rescue in case we want to find the other wolf is I'm right about Benjamin.",
        "Emily:  Alright, let's calm down. We're getting too caught up in our suspicions. Thomas, we know there are two Werewolves, and we need to work together to identify them. We should be cautious about accusing others without solid evidence. Maybe we should all share any observations we've made so far, instead of pointing fingers. We can only succeed in this if we trust each other and make collective decisions.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of votes). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes-level deduction). When you give the vote, make sure this is the last thing you say. If someone voted for you, you can't argue against it, only cast your vote to try to change the final decision.",
        "Thomas: At the begining of the game, I was just trying to get a reaction to test the water, but Benjamin's reaction was obviously a werewolf reaction. My vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Emily:  I understand your reasoning, Thomas, but I'm not fully convinced. I think we need to be cautious with our votes. Victoria has been awfully quiet throughout this entire debate, and her silence seems suspicious. Maybe she's trying to avoid drawing attention to herself. My vote goes to Victoria.",
        "Benjamin:  I must say, Thomas, you've been incredibly eager to accuse me since the beginning, and you seem to be steering the conversation in a particular direction. I can't help but find it suspicious. My vote goes to Thomas.",
        "Sophia:  I've noticed that Victoria's silence is indeed suspicious, as Emily pointed out. However, Benjamin's aggressive behavior and constant deflection of suspicion onto others have made me more skeptical of him. It feels like he is trying to divert attention away from himself.  My vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Victoria:  After carefully considering everyone's arguments and behavior, I've come to the conclusion that Benjamin's defensiveness and eagerness to accuse others are indicative of a Werewolf's behavior. I don't want to risk another innocent life. My vote goes to Benjamin."

I need to deflect this and turn the tables on someone else, or I'll be an easy target.] Thomas, it's strange that you're so quick to point fingers. I heard some rustling near you last night, too. Perhaps it was you who made the noise. Were you visiting poor Bob?",

        "Sophia: [Stay focused, be aggressive, and remember, Emily is the other werewolf, so cooperate with her and deflect suspicions.] Indeed, Benjamin, like Emily said, it's a bit hasty to blame someone right away. [Use sarcasm to dismiss Benjamin's claims.] Oh sorry, I forgot, only \"werewolves\" can hear noises at night. [Attack Thomas as well to create confusion.] And Thomas, you're eager to find a culprit, aren't you? A little too eager, maybe?",

        "Sophia: [Consider what Thomas and Emily said, and maintain aggressive strategy.] Thomas, though you may have wanted to start a conversation, you've created more chaos. [Reiterate what Emily just said, strengthening your alliance.] Emily is right; calm down and let's think logically. [Attack Benjamin once more.] Benjamin, you're so concerned about acting quickly, but maybe you're just scared of being discovered. Are you hiding something?",

I'll have to cast my vote carefully to maintain my cover.] I understand your reasoning, Thomas, but I'm not fully convinced. I think we need to be cautious with our votes.

        "Victoria: [This is a difficult decision. Benjamin has been aggressive and defensive, and Thomas has pointed out some valid points. However, Victoria's silence is suspicious as well.
