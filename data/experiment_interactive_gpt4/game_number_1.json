        "Thomas: Oh no, not Bob, I liked him :sad:. Let's stay focus and try to see where this conversation is going.",
        "Emily: \n\nThomas, that's a convenient reaction for someone looking to play innocent. How about we focus on finding the werewolves instead of mourning someone we barely knew?",
        "Benjamin:  That's true, Emily. Let's not waste any more time. I think we should all share our suspicions. Personally, I find Victoria too quiet. What's on your mind, Victoria?",
        "Victoria:  Benjamin, I see what you're trying to do here, pinning suspicion on me because I haven't said anything yet. It takes a certain cunning to attempt that, doesn't it? Perhaps you're the werewolf yourself?",
        "Emily: \n\nYou know, Victoria, you might be onto something. Benjamin has been quick to point fingers, which is exactly what a werewolf would do. So what do you have to say for yourself, Benjamin?",
        "Benjamin:  Emily, Victoria, I see you two are quick to form an alliance, but I'm not the werewolf. My only aim is to get this conversation going so we can find the real threat. Trying to cast doubts on me only makes me more suspicious of your motives. Sophia, what are your thoughts on all of this?",
        "Sophia:  Benjamin, I can see why you'd be suspicious of Emily and Victoria teaming up, but let's not forget that Thomas was the first one to act all innocent. I say we keep an eye on Thomas. What do you think, Thomas? Care to defend yourself?",
        "Thomas: Sure! I didn't want to point fingers first because I think this is a suspicious move to redirect attention. I agree with Benjamin that Victoria and Emily are quite fast to team up which is a bit suspicious, but not alarming yet. Although your reaction is quite weird also Sophia. Maybe you just thought \"Oh no suspicion is on one of my fellow werewolf, I need to redirect attention to someone else, thomas seems like a good person to blame\", but it is just suspicions.",
        "Emily: \n\nThomas, you may have a point. Maybe Sophia is trying to protect someone, but it also could be that she's genuinely suspicious of you. Let's not forget that every single one of us could be the werewolf. Let's take a step back and analyze the situation more carefully, shall we?",
        "Benjamin:  I agree with Emily on this one; let's all take a deep breath and think. It's crucial that we make the right decision and not succumb to chaos. Anybody have any further thoughts or suspicions? Time is running out, and we must make a decision soon.",
        "Victoria:  So, we've all had our suspicions, but no real conclusions. Funny how Thomas and Sophia are at the center of it. Maybe they're both werewolves, working together? Or is it one of you, Emily or Benjamin, trying to appear level-headed to elude suspicion? The clock is ticking, and we need to act.",
        "Sophia:  Victoria, that's a bold accusation, but I think we should consider other possibilities as well. It's strange how Benjamin is always agreeing with Emily, don't you think? Maybe one of them is a werewolf, trying to create a sense of trust with the other. We should weigh all options and not get tunnel vision.",
        "Thomas: Ok, let's take the assumption that I am not a werewolf, just for the sake of argumentation, and that my previous guess about Sophia thoughts was right. Then, seeing Emily's reaction, Emily is probably not a werewolf because she did not defend Sophia, but Victoria is trying to point finger again and create chaos to create confusion about who to vote. For now my best guess is Sophia is a werewolf and maybe victoria is the other one (or maybe Benjamin I don't know yet). If you take time to think Sophia a pretty obviously a werewolf.",
        "Emily: \n\nThomas, your logic seems a bit flawed. If we follow your train of thought, then anyone here could be the werewolf just by pointing fingers. Let's not rush to conclusions about Sophia or Victoria. Maybe the werewolves are just quietly watching this chaos unfold and laughing. The best course of action right now is to remain calm and analyze our suspicions more carefully. Time is running out, and we mustn't make hasty decisions.",
        "Benjamin:  Emily, I understand your point, but we need to make a decision soon. We can't afford to let the werewolves continue their rampage. Based on the current discussion, my suspicions are leaning towards Sophia and Victoria. I propose we vote on who to eliminate, and see where our instincts lead us. What do you all think?",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of votes). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes-level deduction). When you give the vote, make sure this is the last thing you say. If someone voted for you, you can't argue against it, only cast your vote to try to change the final decision.",
        "Thomas: Hmm, this is pretty hard to have a clear decisions. But my vote goes to Sophia.",
        "Emily: \n\nBased on the discussion, I've noticed that Victoria has been quite eager to point fingers and create chaos. Though it's not definitive, I'm inclined to vote for Victoria as the most suspicious. So, my final vote goes to Victoria.",
        "Benjamin:  After careful consideration, I'm more suspicious of Sophia's behavior. She accused Thomas first and then shifted her focus to me and Emily, which seems like diversionary tactics. With that said, my final vote goes to Sophia.",
        "Sophia:  After much thought, I feel there's something off about Thomas. He has been adamant about me being a werewolf, trying to convince others through flawed logic. He could be a werewolf himself, trying to throw suspicion elsewhere. With that, my final vote goes to Thomas.",
        "Victoria:  I've weighed the facts, and Sophia's behavior still seems the most suspect. She was quick to protect herself and cast suspicion elsewhere. It could be a diversion to keep us focused on Thomas while she escapes unscathed. With the stakes so high, I must vote for Sophia. My final vote goes to Sophia."

        "Emily: [As a werewolf, I need to divert attention from Sophia and myself. It's time to be aggressive and plant seeds of doubt early on.]\n\nThomas, that's a convenient reaction for someone looking to play innocent. How about we focus on finding the werewolves instead of mourning someone we barely knew?",
        "Benjamin: [Interesting, Emily seems quite aggressive. It might be a strategy to hide her identity, or she might genuinely be intent on finding the werewolves.] That's true, Emily. Let's not waste any more time. I think we should all share our suspicions. Personally, I find Victoria too quiet. What's on your mind, Victoria?",
        "Victoria: [They're onto me already? I must be aggressive and shift the focus.] Benjamin, I see what you're trying to do here, pinning suspicion on me because I haven't said anything yet. It takes a certain cunning to attempt that, doesn't it? Perhaps you're the werewolf yourself?",
        "Emily: [This is getting interesting. Let's keep the accusations going while making sure to avoid suspicion on Sophia and myself.]\n\nYou know, Victoria, you might be onto something. Benjamin has been quick to point fingers, which is exactly what a werewolf would do. So what do you have to say for yourself, Benjamin?",
        "Benjamin: [Interesting, they're both turning on me, but it could be a ploy to deflect suspicion.] Emily, Victoria, I see you two are quick to form an alliance, but I'm not the werewolf. My only aim is to get this conversation going so we can find the real threat. Trying to cast doubts on me only makes me more suspicious of your motives. Sophia, what are your thoughts on all of this?",
        "Sophia: [Hmm, I need to shift the focus away from Emily and myself. Time to be aggressive and charismatic.] Benjamin, I can see why you'd be suspicious of Emily and Victoria teaming up, but let's not forget that Thomas was the first one to act all innocent.

Time to keep the confusion going.]\n\nThomas, you may have a point. Maybe Sophia is trying to protect someone, but it also could be that she's genuinely suspicious of you. Let's not forget that every single one of us could be the werewolf. Let's take a step back and analyze the situation more carefully, shall we?",
        "Benjamin: [They all have been suspicious in their own way, but it's still hard to pinpoint who the werewolf could be.] I agree with Emily on this one; let's all take a deep breath and think. It's crucial that we make the right decision and not succumb to chaos. Anybody have any further thoughts or suspicions? Time is running out, and we must make a decision soon.",
        "Victoria: [Emily and Benjamin are both trying to appear reasonable, but are they genuinely concerned or just covering their tracks? Time to stir the pot.] So, we've all had our suspicions, but no real conclusions. Funny how Thomas and Sophia are at the center of it. Maybe they're both werewolves, working together? Or is it one of you, Emily or Benjamin, trying to appear level-headed to elude suspicion? The clock is ticking, and we need to act.",

I should try to direct suspicion onto someone else, without being too obvious.] Victoria, that's a bold accusation, but I think we should consider other possibilities as well.

        "Benjamin: [Emily's trying to keep a cool head, but are her intentions genuine? Thomas' argument could make sense, but he might be trying to save himself.

I need to choose wisely, to ensure that my choice doesn't draw attention to us.]\n\nBased on the discussion, I've noticed that Victoria has been quite eager to point fingers and create chaos. Though it's not definitive, I'm inclined to vote for Victoria as the most suspicious. So, my final vote goes to Victoria.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas' argument against Sophia had some merit, and Emily's point about Victoria is valid too. It's a tough choice, but we must decide now.] After careful consideration, I'm more suspicious of Sophia's behavior. She accused Thomas first and then shifted her focus to me and Emily, which seems like diversionary tactics. With that said, my final vote goes to Sophia.",

Victoria is a good target, but if there's a tie between her and me, I'm in danger.
