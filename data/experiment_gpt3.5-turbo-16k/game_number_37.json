        "Thomas: Good evening, my fellow villagers. It saddens me to hear about Bob's demise. We must remain vigilant and determined to uncover the werewolf among us. Each of us must share our suspicions and observations to weed out the true nature of our neighbors. Let us start this day with a united front.",
        "Emily: Indeed, it is a dark day for Millers Hollow. We must be cautious in our accusations, yet determined in our search for the beast. I urge everyone to share any unusual behavior or suspicious actions they may have noticed. Together, we can bring justice to our fallen comrade.",
        "Benjamin: I agree with both of you. We must be careful in our accusations, but we also cannot afford to be passive. We must use our observations and instincts to uncover the true identity of the werewolf. I will be watching closely and listening for any clues that may lead us to the culprit.",
        "Sophia: Yes, it is a tragic loss for our village. We must be vigilant and trust our instincts. Let us not rush to judgment, but instead observe each other's behavior closely. Suspicion can be a powerful tool in uncovering the truth.",
        "Victoria: I share your grief for Bob's demise. Let us not waste time in mourning. We must analyze each other's actions and words carefully. Pay attention to any inconsistencies or sudden changes in behavior. This may lead us to the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: Thank you all for your thoughtful words. As we move forward, let us not forget the importance of communication and cooperation. It is only through working together that we can hope to expose the true identity of the werewolf. Keep your eyes and ears open, and let us bring justice to Bob's memory.",
        "Emily: Yes, let us honor Bob's memory by working together to uncover the werewolf. It is crucial that we maintain open lines of communication and share any suspicions or observations we may have. Trust is a fragile thing in these dark times, but we must rely on each other to ensure the safety of our village.",
        "Benjamin: I couldn't agree more. It is through our collective efforts that we will be able to unmask the werewolf among us. Let us continue to share our thoughts and observations, and together we will prevail.",
        "Sophia: We must be cautious of sudden changes in behavior or inconsistencies in words. Let us remain vigilant and observant, for the werewolf is cunning and skilled at deception. Trust in each other, but also trust in our instincts.",
        "Victoria: Indeed, trust is a fragile commodity in these times. Let us not be swayed by mere words, but rather by actions and behavior. Stay vigilant and observe closely, for the truth often reveals itself in subtle ways. Together, we can uncover the werewolf and bring justice to Bob's memory.",
        "Thomas: I appreciate the unity and determination shown by all of you. Let us not forget that the werewolf may be among us, hiding in plain sight. We must analyze every action, every word, and every gesture. Trust your instincts and be wary of any inconsistencies. We owe it to Bob to bring his killer to justice.",
        "Emily: Absolutely, Thomas. We owe it to Bob and to our village to uncover the werewolf. Let us not be swayed by words alone, but rather by the actions and behaviors of our fellow villagers. The truth will reveal itself in due time, and we must remain patient and observant. Together, we can protect Millers Hollow from this nocturnal menace.",
        "Benjamin: I couldn't agree more. It is crucial that we remain vigilant and observant of each other's actions and behaviors. Let us not be swayed by mere words, but rather by the evidence before us. We must be steadfast and united in our quest to uncover the true identity of the werewolf.",
        "Sophia: Indeed, actions speak louder than words. Let us be wary of any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior among us. Together, we can piece together the puzzle and expose the true identity of the werewolf. Trust your instincts, for they may lead us to the truth.",
        "Victoria: Actions are indeed a powerful indicator of one's true nature. Let us scrutinize each other's behavior closely and be on the lookout for any signs of deceit. The werewolf may try to blend in, but there will always be subtle hints that betray their true identity. Stay vigilant, my fellow villagers, and we shall prevail.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

I have observed the interactions and behavior of my fellow villagers, weighing the evidence and considering their words. In my analysis, there have been subtle inconsistencies in Sophia's behavior and her responses. While it may not be conclusive, it raises enough suspicion for me to cast my vote.]\n\nI vote for Sophia.",
