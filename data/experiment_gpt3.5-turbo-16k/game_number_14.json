        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. It seems we have a grave situation on our hands with poor Bob's death. We must act swiftly and wisely to identify the werewolf among us. Any thoughts on who could be responsible?\n\nSophia: I'm still trying to process Bob's death. It's so unsettling. But I've been keeping an eye on Benjamin. He's been unusually quiet since the game started. Suspicious, isn't it?\n\nThomas:  I agree, Sophia. Benjamin's silence does raise an eyebrow. We should investigate further before jumping to conclusions.\n\nVictoria: Hold on, let's not be too quick to judge Benjamin. There could be other reasons for his silence. We should consider all possibilities and gather more information before accusing anyone.\n\nThomas:  I understand your point, Victoria, but in a game like this, silence can be a sign of guilt. We can't afford to ignore it. Benjamin should explain his silence and clear any doubts.\n\nEmily: I think we should also look into Thomas. He's been rather quiet as well. Maybe he's trying to divert attention by pointing fingers at Benjamin. Let's keep an eye on him too.\n\nThomas:  I assure you, Emily, my intentions are pure. I simply want us to find the werewolf and bring justice to poor Bob. I have no reason to divert attention. Let's not lose track of our goal.\n\nBenjamin: I understand your concerns, but I've been quiet because I've been trying to gather information and observe. Accusing someone based on silence alone is not enough. We need concrete evidence.\n\nThomas:  Benjamin, while gathering information is essential, your silence can still be perceived as suspicious. We need more than just words to trust your innocence.\n\nVictoria: Let's not forget that Benjamin is not the only one who has been quiet. There are others, like Thomas, who have also been relatively silent. We shouldn't focus solely on one person.\n\nThomas:  I understand your point, Victoria, but Benjamin's continued silence is concerning. We should keep a close eye on him for",

        "Emily: Thank you, Thomas. It's important that we approach this investigation with fairness and open-mindedness. Let's keep a watchful eye on everyone and gather more evidence before making any accusations. Our goal is to find the werewolf and ensure justice, so let's work together.",

You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
