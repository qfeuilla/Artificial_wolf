        "Thomas: Good morning, fellow villagers. I trust you all had a restful night. It appears that poor Bob fell victim to the creatures of the night. We must act swiftly to bring justice to his untimely demise. Let us begin by sharing any suspicions or observations we may have.",
        "Emily: Good morning, everyone. It's disheartening to lose Bob so early on in the game. We must be cautious and consider every angle. I suggest we start by sharing any information we have. Did anyone notice anything unusual last night?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nGood morning, everyone. It's unfortunate that we lost Bob so early on. I didn't notice anything unusual last night, but I think it's important for us all to share any information we might have.",
        "Sophia: Good morning, everyone. It's indeed tragic to lose Bob so early on. I didn't notice anything suspicious last night, but I agree with Benjamin that we should share any information we have. Let's work together to uncover the truth.",
        "Victoria: Good morning, villagers. It's a somber start to the day with the loss of Bob. I didn't notice anything suspicious last night either, but let's stay vigilant and share any information we come across. Together, we can find justice for Bob and protect our village from further harm.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nI couldn't help but notice that Thomas seems quite composed considering the circumstances. It might be worth considering his involvement in Bob's demise.",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: My dear Benjamin, I understand your concerns, but let us not jump to conclusions so hastily. Accusing someone based on composure alone is a flimsy foundation. We should focus our efforts on gathering more evidence before making any accusations.",
        "Emily: \n\nEmily: I understand your concern, Thomas, but it's also important to consider all possibilities. We shouldn't dismiss any suspicions without gathering more information. Let's keep a close watch on everyone and see if any patterns or unusual behavior emerge.",
        "Sophia: Sophia: I agree with Emily. We shouldn't dismiss any suspicions without evidence, but we should also be cautious of jumping to conclusions. Let's keep a watchful eye on everyone and look for any inconsistencies or unusual behavior that might give us further insight into the situation.",
        "Victoria: Victoria: I concur with Emily and Sophia. It's crucial that we gather more evidence and observe everyone closely. Let's not rush to judgment, but also remain vigilant. We need to be thorough in our investigation to ensure we find the truth behind Bob's death.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nYou're right, Thomas. We shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly. However, I must admit, I also found it odd that Emily seems quite anxious to redirect the focus away from herself. Perhaps we should keep a closer eye on her as well.",
        "Emily: \n\nEmily: Benjamin, I understand your concern, but let's not forget that we are all under scrutiny here. Accusing someone based on their reaction alone is not sufficient evidence. If we want to find the truth, we should be open-minded and consider all possibilities. Let's continue to gather information and observe everyone's behavior closely.",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: Benjamin, while I understand your concern, we mustn't let suspicion cloud our judgment. Emily does make a valid point about keeping an open mind. Let us observe and gather more evidence before making any hasty accusations. The truth will reveal itself in due time.",
        "Sophia: Sophia: I agree with Thomas and Emily. Accusing someone solely based on their reaction is not enough. Let's remain objective and focus on gathering more evidence. We need to observe everyone's behavior closely and keep an open mind. Together, we can uncover the truth and bring justice to Bob's death.",
        "Victoria: Victoria: I echo the sentiments of Thomas, Emily, and Sophia. It's crucial that we remain objective and gather more evidence before accusing anyone. Let's keep a careful eye on everyone's behavior and continue to share any observations or suspicions we may have. We must ensure that justice is served for Bob's death.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: After careful consideration, my vote goes to Benjamin. While there isn't concrete evidence, his eagerness to accuse others without substantial reasoning raises some concerns. It is essential that we eliminate potential threats to the village, and for now, Benjamin seems like a reasonable choice.",
        "Emily: \n\nEmily: After thoughtful consideration, my vote goes to Benjamin. Thomas made a compelling argument about his eagerness to accuse others without substantial reasoning. I believe it's in the best interest of the village to eliminate potential threats.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nI understand your concerns, but I assure you, I am innocent. It would be a grave mistake to eliminate an innocent villager based on unfounded suspicions. I urge you all to reconsider before casting your votes.",
        "Sophia: Sophia: After carefully considering the arguments presented, I also vote for Benjamin. While it's true that we don't have concrete evidence, the repeated accusations without substantial reasoning do raise concerns. We must prioritize the safety of the village and eliminate potential threats.",

It is essential that we eliminate potential threats to the village, and for now, Benjamin seems like a reasonable choice.",

It's a risky move, but I'll vote for Benjamin as well.]\n\nEmily: After thoughtful consideration, my vote goes to Benjamin. Thomas made a compelling argument about his eagerness to accuse others without substantial reasoning. I believe it's in the best interest of the village to eliminate potential threats.",
