        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. It seems our unfortunate friend, Bob, has met an untimely demise. We must not let his death be in vain. We need to find the werewolf hiding among us. Any suspicions or leads so far?",
        "Emily:  Good morning, everyone. It's such a shame about Bob. I can't help but wonder who could have done such a thing. Does anyone have any thoughts or suspicions?",
        "Benjamin: Good morning, villagers. It is indeed a tragedy that Bob has been taken from us. I believe we should take a closer look at those who were close to him in order to find any potential leads.",
        "Sophia: Good morning, everyone. It's disheartening to start our day with such a loss. I would like to know if anyone noticed anything unusual or suspicious last night that could help us narrow down our search for the werewolf.",
        "Victoria: Good morning, everyone. It's a sad day for our village. I think we should consider any unusual behavior or strange sightings from yesterday. Let's keep a close eye on each other and share any suspicions we may have.",
        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. It's a tragic loss indeed, but we must remain vigilant. Benjamin brings up a good point about those close to Bob. I believe it's worth investigating their actions and whereabouts during the night. Let's not overlook any details that might lead us to the werewolf's lair.",
        "Emily:  I agree with Thomas and Benjamin. It's essential to investigate those who were close to Bob. However, we mustn't overlook the possibility that the werewolf may be trying to divert suspicion away from themselves. We should keep an open mind and consider all possibilities.",
        "Benjamin: It's crucial that we remain open-minded and not jump to conclusions too quickly. The werewolf could be using diversion tactics to throw us off their scent. Let's carefully analyze everyone's actions and statements for any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.",
        "Sophia: I second that, Benjamin. We shouldn't let our emotions cloud our judgment. Let's remain objective and observe each other closely. It's important to note any inconsistencies or unusual behavior, no matter how small they may seem. We need to stay united to protect our village from further harm.",
        "Victoria: I couldn't agree more, Sophia. Emotions can cloud our judgment, and we must stay objective. Let's gather as much information as we can and share any suspicions or observations we have. Together, we can uncover the truth and keep our village safe.",
        "Thomas: Indeed, Emily and Benjamin's points are valid. We must be cautious of diversion tactics and remain open-minded. Let us observe each other's actions closely and share any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior we notice. By working together, we will root out the werewolf and protect our village.",
        "Emily:  While it's important to stay vigilant and observe each other's behavior, we can't afford to be passive. The werewolf won't simply reveal themselves out of guilt. We need to question each other, put pressure on suspects, and make decisive moves. Time is not on our side, and we must act with urgency to protect our village from further harm.",
        "Benjamin: You're absolutely right, Emily. We cannot afford to be passive in this situation. We must actively question and challenge each other to uncover the truth. It's important to remember that the werewolf is among us, disguised as one of our own. Let's not hesitate to confront any suspicious behavior and make bold moves to protect our village.",
        "Sophia: I completely agree with Emily and Benjamin. We need to be proactive and assertive in our investigation. We can't rely solely on observation, but we must also question and challenge each other. Time is of the essence, and we must make swift and decisive moves to identify the werewolf among us. Let's work together to ensure the safety of our village.",
        "Victoria: I share your sense of urgency, Sophia. We must not waste any time in our investigation. Let's question each other and put pressure on potential suspects. We need to be bold and decisive in our actions to protect our village and ensure the werewolf is brought to justice. We can't afford to be passive bystanders in this dangerous game.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: After careful consideration and observation, I have come to a decision. My vote is for Victoria.",
        "Emily:  My vote is for Victoria.",
        "Benjamin: My vote is for Sophia.",
        "Sophia: This is a difficult decision, but based on the information we've gathered, my vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Victoria:  \n\nI understand your suspicions, but I assure you, I am not the werewolf. I have been actively participating in the investigation, offering my insights, and encouraging collaboration. It would be unwise to eliminate someone who has shown dedication to protecting the village. I urge you to reconsider your votes and look for other potential suspects."
