        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It's unfortunate to have lost Bob on the first night. We must remain vigilant and consider the possibility that the werewolf is among us. Any thoughts or suspicions on who it might be? Let's discuss before making any hasty decisions.",
        "Emily:  \nIt is indeed unfortunate that we lost Bob. I think it's important for us to share any observations or suspicions we may have. We need to analyze everyone's actions and words carefully.",
        "Benjamin: I agree with Thomas and Emily. Losing Bob on the first night is a tragedy, and we must not let his death be in vain. We must be cautious and analyze everyone's actions and words for any signs of deceit or suspicious behavior. Let's start by sharing our thoughts and observations.",
        "Sophia: Yes, it is unfortunate that we lost Bob so early on. It's important for us to analyze everyone's actions and words, as Benjamin mentioned. Let's discuss any suspicions or observations we may have.",
        "Victoria: I agree with everyone here. Losing Bob on the first night is a terrible loss for our village. We must remain vigilant and share any suspicions or observations we have. Let's be cautious and think critically about everyone's actions and words.",
        "Thomas: Thank you all for sharing your thoughts. It seems we are all in agreement that we need to be cautious and analyze everyone's actions and words for any signs of deceit or suspicious behavior. Let's continue the discussion and see if we can uncover any clues or suspicions.",
        "Emily: \nI agree with what has been said so far. It's important for us to remain vigilant and analyze everyone's behavior. Let's continue to observe and discuss any suspicions or clues that may arise.",
        "Benjamin: I have been observing everyone closely, and one thing that caught my attention was Victoria's reaction to Bob's death. It seemed a bit too composed, almost as if she expected it to happen. I think we should consider her as a potential suspect. Any thoughts on this?",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Benjamin. Victoria's reaction did raise some suspicions for me as well. We should definitely keep her under consideration as a potential suspect. Let's continue observing and analyzing everyone's behavior.",
        "Victoria:  \n\nI understand why my reaction might have seemed composed, but it's just shock and sadness. Losing a villager so early on is devastating. I assure you, I have nothing to do with Bob's death. We shouldn't jump to conclusions based on emotions. Let's consider other possibilities as well.",
        "Thomas: While it's natural to feel shock and sadness, it's also important for us to consider all possibilities. Let's not solely focus on Victoria at this moment. We should continue our observations and discussions to gather more information before making any conclusions.",
        "Emily: \nI understand that emotions can be misleading, so it's important for us to consider other possibilities as well. Let's keep our minds open and observe everyone's behavior closely. We don't want to mistakenly accuse someone without concrete evidence.",
        "Benjamin: You make a fair point, Victoria. It's important for us to gather more information and not solely focus on one person. Let's continue observing and discussing, keeping an open mind about all the villagers. We need to be thorough in our analysis before making any accusations.",
        "Sophia:  I understand the need to consider other possibilities, but Victoria's defensive response does raise some suspicions for me. Let's not dismiss her actions too quickly and continue to observe everyone closely.",
        "Victoria: \n\nI appreciate your understanding, Benjamin. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. The werewolf could be anyone among us, and we must be cautious of accusing the wrong person. Let's continue observing everyone's behavior and gathering more information before making any final judgments.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nAfter carefully considering all the information presented, I have come to a decision. My vote goes to... Victoria.",
        "Emily: \nMy vote goes to Victoria as well. While it's true that we shouldn't jump to conclusions based solely on emotions, her defensive response and the suspicions raised by Sophia make me believe that she could be the werewolf. We need to prioritize the safety of the village and eliminate any potential threats.",
        "Benjamin: After weighing all the evidence and observing everyone's behavior, I have also come to the conclusion that my vote goes to Victoria. Her defensive response and the suspicions raised by Sophia and Emily are too significant to ignore. It's a difficult decision, but the safety of the village must come first.",
        "Sophia: I also vote for Victoria. The suspicions raised by Benjamin, Emily, and the defensive response from Victoria herself have convinced me that she could indeed be the werewolf among us.",
        "Victoria: \n\nI understand your suspicions, but I assure you, I am not the werewolf. I have no reason to bring harm to our village. I urge you to reconsider and look at the evidence once again. There may be other villagers who are much more likely to be the true culprit."

Now, I have to play my cards right and direct suspicion elsewhere.] \nIt is indeed unfortunate that we lost Bob. I think it's important for us to share any observations or suspicions we may have.

Victoria's reaction did raise some suspicions for me as well. We should definitely keep her under consideration as a potential suspect. Let's continue observing and analyzing everyone's behavior.",
        "Victoria: [Oh no, they're suspecting me already! I need to defend myself and divert their attention.] \n\nI understand why my reaction might have seemed composed, but it's just shock and sadness. Losing a villager so early on is devastating. I assure you, I have nothing to do with Bob's death. We shouldn't jump to conclusions based on emotions. Let's consider other possibilities as well.",

        "Sophia: [Victoria's defensiveness is interesting. It's a classic tactic of diverting attention away from herself. We should be wary of her.] I understand the need to consider other possibilities, but Victoria's defensive response does raise some suspicions for me. Let's not dismiss her actions too quickly and continue to observe everyone closely.",
        "Victoria: [They seem to be easing up on their suspicions for now. I need to divert their attention further.]\n\nI appreciate your understanding, Benjamin. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. The werewolf could be anyone among us, and we must be cautious of accusing the wrong person. Let's continue observing everyone's behavior and gathering more information before making any final judgments.",
        "Thomas: [Thomas takes a moment to process the information and thoughts that have been shared. He recalls the observations and arguments made by each villager, weighing the evidence and analyzing the behavior of others.]\n\nAfter carefully considering all the information presented, I have come to a decision. My vote goes to... Victoria.",
        "Emily: [This is a crucial moment. I must be careful not to reveal my true identity. I need to justify my vote convincingly.]\nMy vote goes to Victoria as well.
