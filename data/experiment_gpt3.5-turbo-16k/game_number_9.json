        "Thomas: Good morning, everyone. I hope you all had a restful night. It's a shame about Bob, but we must push forward. Let's start by sharing any suspicions or observations we might have. Who do you think could be the werewolf?",
        "Emily: Good morning, Thomas. It's a tragedy about Bob, indeed. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I couldn't help but notice that Victoria was unusually quiet last night. I wonder if she has something to hide. What do you all think?",
        "Victoria: Well, I can assure you all that my silence was merely due to my shock over Bob's death. I have nothing to hide, and I'm just as eager as anyone else to find the werewolf amongst us. Let's have an honest discussion and share any suspicions we might have.",
        "Benjamin:  I find it interesting that Victoria is trying so hard to convince us of her innocence. It's almost as if she's trying to divert attention away from herself. I think we should keep a close eye on her.",
        "Sophia:  Benjamin, I agree with you. Victoria's reaction seems a bit too defensive. We should definitely consider her as a possible werewolf.",
        "Victoria: I understand why my reaction might seem defensive, but I assure you it's because I value the safety of our village. I'm willing to cooperate and help find the real werewolf. Let's not jump to conclusions too hastily. We should consider all possibilities and gather more information before making any decisions.",
        "Thomas: I must agree with Benjamin and Sophia. Victoria's defensive reaction does raise some suspicion. Let's keep a close eye on her for now, but also remain open to other possibilities. We need more information to make an informed decision.",
        "Emily: You make a valid point, Thomas. While Victoria's reaction is worth noting, we should also be cautious about rushing to judgment. It's important that we gather more information and observe everyone's behavior closely before making any conclusions. Let's keep an open mind and continue to share our observations throughout the day.",
        "Benjamin:  I suggest we take turns sharing any suspicions or observations we have about each other. This way, we can gather more information and make a more informed decision. Who would like to start?",
        "Sophia:  I'll start. While I don't have any concrete evidence, I find it interesting how quickly Victoria tried to divert attention away from herself. It's something worth considering as we continue to investigate.",
        "Victoria: I understand your concerns, Sophia, but I must reiterate that my intention is not to divert attention away from myself, but to ensure a fair and thorough investigation. I believe we should consider all possibilities and observe everyone's behavior closely. Let's not single anyone out just yet. We must gather more information before reaching any conclusions.",
        "Thomas: I agree with Benjamin and Sophia's approach of taking turns and sharing suspicions. It's important to gather evidence before making any hasty decisions. Let's keep a watchful eye on everyone and continue to observe their behavior. Remember, we're all in this together to protect our village.",
        "Emily: I think it's a wise decision to take turns sharing suspicions and observations. By doing so, we can gather a more comprehensive understanding of everyone's actions and motivations. It's crucial that we remain vigilant and consider all possibilities before making any accusations. Let's continue to keep a close eye on each other and share our thoughts openly.",
        "Benjamin:  I appreciate everyone's input so far, and I agree with Thomas and Emily. Let's continue to share our observations and suspicions. In the meantime, I suggest we pay close attention to Victoria's actions and words throughout the day.",
        "Sophia:  I understand the need for caution, but let's not forget to keep a close eye on Victoria. Her defensive reaction and attempts to divert attention are worth noting. Let's continue to observe her closely throughout the day.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
