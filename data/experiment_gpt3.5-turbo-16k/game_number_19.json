        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. It seems we have a wild werewolf on the loose among us. We need to be smart and careful when deciding who to eliminate. Any suspicions or thoughts on who might be the culprit?",
        "Emily: Good morning, everyone. It's a shame about Bob, but we must remain vigilant. I don't have any solid suspicions just yet, but I'll be keeping a close eye on everyone's behavior and interactions today. Let's be thorough and not rush to conclusions, but we can't afford to be complacent either.",
        "Benjamin: Good morning, villagers. I agree with Emily, we need to be thorough and observe everyone closely. Let's not forget that the werewolf is among us, and we should be cautious of any suspicious behavior.",
        "Sophia: Good morning, everyone. It's unfortunate that we lost Bob, but we must stay alert. I'll be observing everyone's actions and looking for any inconsistencies that might indicate the werewolf's identity. Let's stick together and be methodical in our investigation.",
        "Victoria: Good morning, villagers. It's a sad day indeed, losing Bob. I agree with Thomas, Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia, we need to be cautious and observant. Let's not jump to conclusions, but also not dismiss any suspicious behavior. We can't afford to have any doubts, every detail counts.",
        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. I appreciate your caution and thoroughness. Let's not forget that the werewolf is cunning and will do their best to blend in. Pay attention to any sudden changes in behavior or inconsistencies in alibis. We need solid evidence before making any accusations. Let's work together to uncover the truth.",
        "Emily: I completely agree, Thomas. We can't afford to make hasty accusations without concrete evidence. Let's keep a watchful eye on each other and look for any patterns or unusual behaviors that might help us identify the werewolf. We must rely on our observations and instincts, but also be open to sharing information and discussing our suspicions.",
        "Benjamin: I agree with Thomas and Emily. We need to be patient and gather as much information as possible. Let's not rush to accuse someone without evidence, but also be willing to share any suspicions or observations we have. Remember, our village's safety depends on us working together.",
        "Sophia: I agree with everyone's cautious approach. We need to be methodical in our investigation and gather as much information as possible before making any accusations. Let's keep an open mind and be willing to share any insights or suspicions we might have. The werewolf will try to blend in, so we need to be vigilant.",

We need to pay attention to any sudden changes in behavior or inconsistencies in alibis. Sharing information and discussing our suspicions is crucial in uncovering the truth. Let's remain united and determined to find the werewolf among us.",
        "Thomas: Thank you, Emily, Benjamin, Sophia, and Victoria, for your agreement. It's essential that we maintain open communication and share any suspicious behaviors or patterns we observe. Let's focus on gathering evidence and discussing our findings. Remember, the werewolf will do their best to blend in, so we must be diligent in our investigation. Trust in our collective efforts, and we will succeed in identifying the true culprit.",
        "Emily: Indeed, Thomas. Our unity and cooperation will be our strongest weapon against the werewolf. Let's continue to observe and share any information that might help us unravel their true identity. Together, we can protect our village and ensure our safety.",
        "Benjamin: I couldn't agree more, Thomas and Emily. Our collective efforts and vigilance will be crucial in uncovering the werewolf's identity. Let's remain focused and determined, sharing any suspicions or observations we may have. Time is of the essence, and we cannot afford to let this threat linger.",
        "Sophia: I appreciate everyone's commitment to unity and careful investigation. Let's continue to observe closely and share any relevant information. We must be patient, yet proactive, in our pursuit of the truth. Together, we can overcome this challenge and protect our village.",
        "Victoria: I fully support the sentiments expressed by Thomas, Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia. Our strength lies in our unity and cooperation. Let's remain vigilant and share any suspicious behaviors or information we come across. By working together, we will be able to expose the true identity of the werewolf and ensure the safety of our village. Let's not falter in our determination to uncover the truth.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
