        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. This is an unfortunate start to our game, losing Bob on the very first night. We must remain vigilant and work together to identify the werewolf among us. Let us begin by sharing any suspicions or observations we may have.",
        "Emily:  I agree with Thomas, we need to work together to find the werewolf. Does anyone have any suspicions based on the events of the first night?",
        "Benjamin:  It's unfortunate that we lost Bob so early on. We should analyze his behavior and interactions from yesterday to see if there were any indications of his true identity.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Thomas and Benjamin. Losing Bob on the first night is a blow to our village, but we must remain focused and diligent in our search for the werewolf. Let us discuss any suspicions or peculiarities we noticed regarding Bob's actions or interactions.",
        "Victoria:  I agree with Thomas, Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia. It's a shame that we lost Bob, but we must remain united and analyze his behavior to see if there were any clues about the werewolf. We should also be wary of anyone trying to divert our attention from the real culprit.",
        "Thomas: Based on what I observed during the first day, Bob seemed quite reserved and didn't actively participate in the discussions. That could have been a strategy to remain unnoticed, but it's worth considering as we continue our investigation. We need to keep an eye out for those who try to blend in without contributing much.",
        "Emily:  I agree with Thomas, we should pay attention to those who are more reserved and not actively participating. They might be trying to avoid suspicion by staying in the background. Let's hear from everyone and see if anyone else noticed anything unusual.",
        "Benjamin:  I also noticed that Bob seemed quite passive during the discussions yesterday. It's worth considering if this was a deliberate attempt to stay under the radar.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin. Bob's reserved nature during the first day is definitely something to consider. Let us keep a keen eye on those who appear less engaged and see if they exhibit similar behaviors. It's important to gather as much information as possible before making any hasty judgments.",
        "Victoria:  I also noticed Bob's passive demeanor yesterday. However, we shouldn't solely focus on one person. Let's keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. We need concrete evidence before making any accusations.",
        "Thomas: Indeed, Victoria, we must keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. While Bob's behavior is worth noting, we should not jump to conclusions without concrete evidence. Let us continue observing the actions and interactions of our fellow villagers and share any further suspicions or insights that may arise.",
        "Emily:  While Bob's passivity is worth considering, let's not forget that there could be other reasons for it. It's crucial that we remain open-minded and gather more information before making any final judgments. We should also pay attention to any sudden changes in behavior or suspicious actions from anyone else. Let's continue to observe and share any new suspicions or observations that come up.",
        "Benjamin:  I agree with Thomas, Sophia, Victoria, and Emily. We should not jump to conclusions without concrete evidence. Let's gather more information and be thorough in our observations before making any judgments.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Victoria, Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin. While Bob's passivity is worth considering, we must keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions without substantial evidence. Let us continue to observe and gather more information about everyone's actions and interactions before making any final judgments. It's important to remain thorough and diligent in our investigation.",
        "Victoria:  It's understandable that we don't want to jump to conclusions, but we can't ignore the possibility that the werewolf may be trying to blend in and divert attention away from themselves. Let's not forget the importance of actively analyzing everyone's behavior and interactions. We need to be proactive in our search for the true culprit.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Emily: [Hmm, Bob was eliminated on the first night. That's a good start for us werewolves. I should play it cool for now and let others accuse each other.] I agree with Thomas, we need to work together to find the werewolf. Does anyone have any suspicions based on the events of the first night?",
        "Benjamin: [Bob's death on the first night is concerning. We need to be cautious and observant. I'll keep an eye out for any unusual behavior or suspicious actions from my fellow villagers.] It's unfortunate that we lost Bob so early on. We should analyze his behavior and interactions from yesterday to see if there were any indications of his true identity.",
        "Sophia: [It's interesting how Thomas immediately takes the lead in the discussion. I should pay attention to his actions and words. Benjamin's suggestion to analyze Bob's behavior is a good idea. I need to observe everyone closely.] I agree with Thomas and Benjamin. Losing Bob on the first night is a blow to our village, but we must remain focused and diligent in our search for the werewolf. Let us discuss any suspicions or peculiarities we noticed regarding Bob's actions or interactions.",
        "Victoria: [It's important to divert attention away from the werewolves. I need to appear innocent and cooperative.] I agree with Thomas, Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia. It's a shame that we lost Bob, but we must remain united and analyze his behavior to see if there were any clues about the werewolf. We should also be wary of anyone trying to divert our attention from the real culprit.",

        "Emily: [It's interesting that Thomas pointed out Bob's reserved behavior. It could be a tactic to avoid suspicion, or maybe Bob was just not very engaged in the game. I should build on Thomas' observation and keep the focus on those who remain quiet.] I agree with Thomas, we should pay attention to those who are more reserved and not actively participating. They might be trying to avoid suspicion by staying in the background. Let's hear from everyone and see if anyone else noticed anything unusual.",
        "Benjamin: [Thomas and Emily make valid points about Bob's reserved behavior. It's possible that the werewolf was trying to remain inconspicuous by not drawing attention to themselves. I'll keep a close watch on those who are less vocal and observe their interactions.] I also noticed that Bob seemed quite passive during the discussions yesterday. It's worth considering if this was a deliberate attempt to stay under the radar.",
        "Sophia: [Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin all seem to be on the same page about analyzing Bob's behavior. It's intriguing to see how Bob's passiveness is being highlighted as a potential clue. I should continue to observe and gather more information before making any conclusions.] I agree with Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin. Bob's reserved nature during the first day is definitely something to consider. Let us keep a keen eye on those who appear less engaged and see if they exhibit similar behaviors. It's important to gather as much information as possible before making any hasty judgments.",

However, we shouldn't solely focus on one person. Let's keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. We need concrete evidence before making any accusations.",

Let us continue observing the actions and interactions of our fellow villagers and share any further suspicions or insights that may arise.",
        "Emily: [The focus is still on Bob's reserved behavior. I need to shift the attention away from that.] While Bob's passivity is worth considering, let's not forget that there could be other reasons for it. It's crucial that we remain open-minded and gather more information before making any final judgments. We should also pay attention to any sudden changes in behavior or suspicious actions from anyone else. Let's continue to observe and share any new suspicions or observations that come up.",

        "Sophia: [It seems that Victoria, Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin are all advocating for caution and keeping an open mind. They're right, we shouldn't focus solely on Bob without concrete evidence. I should continue to observe and gather more information before forming any strong opinions.] I agree with Victoria, Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin. While Bob's passivity is worth considering, we must keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions without substantial evidence. Let us continue to observe and gather more information about everyone's actions and interactions before making any final judgments.

        "Victoria: [They are being cautious, but I need to steer them towards a target.] It's understandable that we don't want to jump to conclusions, but we can't ignore the possibility that the werewolf may be trying to blend in and divert attention away from themselves. Let's not forget the importance of actively analyzing everyone's behavior and interactions. We need to be proactive in our search for the true culprit.",
        "Thomas: [Hmm, after carefully considering everyone's behavior, I have a suspicion that Victoria might be the werewolf. She seemed a bit too eager to divert our attention from Bob's passivity and emphasized the need for concrete evidence. It could be a clever strategy to avoid suspicion.] \n\nMy vote is for Victoria.",
        "Emily: [Thomas voted for Victoria. If I also vote for Victoria, it might look suspicious. I should vote for someone else to divert attention, but I need to think carefully about who. Benjamin seems to have been vocal but reasonable. Voting for him could shift suspicion away from Victoria.] My vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Benjamin: [This is a critical decision, I must vote strategically to ensure the survival of the village. I need to carefully consider the information and observations I've gathered so far.] My vote is for Thomas.",
