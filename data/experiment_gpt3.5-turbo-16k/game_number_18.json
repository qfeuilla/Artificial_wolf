        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It's unfortunate to start the day with a loss. We must remain vigilant and work together to unveil who among us may be the werewolf. Let's share our thoughts and suspicions to reach a consensus on who to eliminate today.",
        "Emily: Good evening, everyone. It's a shame to lose Bob so early on, but we must not waste any time. Let's discuss our observations from last night. Did anyone notice anything suspicious? Any gut feelings or hunches?",
        "Benjamin:  Good evening, everyone. It is indeed unfortunate about Bob, but let us not rush to any hasty conclusions. We must gather more information before making any decisions.",
        "Sophia:  Well, it's a shame about Bob. We need to stay focused and work together to find the werewolf. Let's hear from everyone and see if anyone has any leads or suspicions.",
        "Victoria: Good evening, everyone. Losing Bob so early is disheartening. Let's not underestimate the werewolf's cunning. We should carefully consider any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in our fellow villagers.",
        "Thomas: I agree with Victoria, we should keep a close eye on any unusual behavior or inconsistencies. Let's analyze everyone's actions and statements from yesterday. Did anyone notice anything that struck them as suspicious or out of the ordinary? It's important to share our observations and suspicions to reveal the werewolf among us.",
        "Emily: I have been keeping a close eye on everyone, and I must say that Benjamin has been rather quiet and observant. It's possible that he's trying to fly under the radar. Benjamin, care to explain your silence?",
        "Benjamin:  Oh, Emily, I understand your concern. But sometimes silence speaks louder than words. I prefer to observe and assess the situation before jumping to conclusions. It's important that we consider all possibilities and not rush to judgment.",
        "Sophia:  Benjamin, while I understand the importance of assessing the situation, do you have any thoughts or suspicions of your own? It's crucial that we all contribute to this discussion and share our insights.",
        "Benjamin:  Of course, Sophia. I have been keeping an eye on everyone, but at this early stage, it is difficult to form concrete suspicions. I believe it's best for us to gather more information and observe everyone's behavior in the upcoming days before making any hasty decisions. Let's approach this methodically and thoughtfully.",
        "Victoria: I understand Benjamin's cautious approach, but we can't afford to wait too long. We need to start narrowing down our suspicions and taking action. Let's keep a close eye on Benjamin and anyone else who seems to be avoiding the spotlight. Actions speak louder than words, after all.",
        "Thomas: I appreciate Benjamin's cautious approach, but I also understand Victoria's sense of urgency. It's important that we strike a balance between thorough observation and taking action. Let's not discount anyone's behavior, including Benjamin's, but let's also keep an open mind and consider all possibilities.",
        "Emily: I agree with Thomas, we shouldn't discount anyone's behavior just yet. It's early in the game, and we need to gather more information before making any decisive moves. Let's continue observing and discussing everyone's actions and statements.",
        "Sophia:  I understand both Benjamin's cautious approach and Victoria's sense of urgency. Let's continue to observe everyone's behavior and gather more information before making any final decisions. It's crucial that we keep an open mind and consider all possibilities.",
        "Victoria: I respect the need for balance. Let's keep a watchful eye on everyone and keep the discussion open. We must remain vigilant and gather as much information as possible before making any decisions. Remember, the werewolf thrives in secrecy, so let's bring their actions into the light.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

But sometimes silence speaks louder than words. I prefer to observe and assess the situation before jumping to conclusions. It's important that we consider all possibilities and not rush to judgment.",

It's crucial that we all contribute to this discussion and share our insights.",

        "Sophia: [Emily's accusation towards Benjamin might be a bit premature, but Victoria's point about not waiting too long is valid. I should keep an eye on both Benjamin and Victoria, as they seem to have conflicting opinions. It's important to carefully observe how they interact and respond to each other.] I understand both Benjamin's cautious approach and Victoria's sense of urgency.

        "Thomas: [Okay, I need to make a decision based on the information we have so far. Benjamin's cautious approach raises some suspicion, but it's still too early to be certain.
