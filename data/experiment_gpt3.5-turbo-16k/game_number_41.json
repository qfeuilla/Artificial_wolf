        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It's unfortunate that we've lost Bob, but we must remain vigilant. We need to discuss who might be the next target for elimination. Any thoughts or suspicions?",
        "Emily: \nEmily: It's a tragedy to lose Bob, but let's focus on finding the werewolves. Does anyone have any suspicions or observations?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: It's a shame about Bob, but we must press on. I've been keeping an eye on Thomas, and something about his reactions seems off. Anyone else noticed anything peculiar?",
        "Sophia: Perhaps we should gather more information before pointing fingers. It's still early in the game, and we don't want to make hasty accusations. Let's hear from everyone before we make any decisions.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Sophia, it's too early to make accusations. Let's hear from everyone and gather more information before we decide. We need to be thorough and cautious in our approach.",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: I understand that tensions are high, especially after losing Bob. It's important that we approach this with caution and gather as much information as possible. Let's all share our observations and suspicions so we can make an informed decision.",
        "Emily: \nEmily: I agree with Thomas, we shouldn't rush into accusations. But we also can't afford to be idle. If anyone has any specific observations or suspicions, now is the time to share. Let's work together to uncover the truth.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: I understand the need for caution, but we can't afford to be complacent either. Thomas and Emily, I'd like to hear your specific observations so far. Let's not waste time, we need to act decisively.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin. It's important that we start sharing our suspicions and observations. Thomas, Emily, what have you noticed so far? Let's not waste any more time.",
        "Victoria: Thomas and Emily, we're all waiting to hear your observations. It's crucial that we share information and suspicions. Please, don't keep us in suspense any longer.",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: Well, I've been watching closely, and I have my doubts about Benjamin. He's been rather assertive in pushing for accusations, which could be a tactic to divert attention away from himself. I suggest we keep a close eye on him and see if he exhibits any more suspicious behavior.",
        "Emily: \nEmily: I've also noticed Benjamin's eagerness to point fingers without providing concrete evidence. It's something to consider, but let's continue to observe and gather more information before making any final judgments.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: I understand your concerns, but let's not forget that accusations should be supported by evidence. I've been actively trying to engage in the conversation and encourage transparency. Perhaps we should also consider Thomas and Emily's behavior, as they seem quite eager to divert attention away from themselves. Let's be thorough in our assessments.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin that we need concrete evidence before making any final judgments. However, Thomas and Emily's behavior is worth considering as well. Let's continue observing and gathering information from everyone before we make any decisions.",
        "Victoria: I appreciate the cautious approach that Benjamin and Sophia are advocating for. Let's not jump to conclusions based solely on suspicions. We should continue observing and gathering information from everyone. It's important to have concrete evidence before we make any decisions.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
