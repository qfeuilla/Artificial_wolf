        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Strange? Surely you're mistaken, Emily. I was merely lost in thought.",
        "Sophia:  \n\nSophia: Benjamin, could you share what you were thinking about? It might help put Emily's suspicions to rest.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Ah, well, I was actually contemplating the nature of our recent misfortune. It's quite a tragedy to lose poor Bob.",
        "Victoria: Victoria: I have my doubts about Benjamin as well. His reaction seems a bit too composed for my liking. We should keep a close eye on him.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Composed? Oh, I assure you, Victoria, it's merely my way of coping with such unfortunate events. May I remind you all that pointing fingers without substantial evidence can lead to innocent lives being accused. Let's approach this with caution and reason.",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: Benjamin, while I appreciate your call for caution, it's also important that we thoroughly investigate all possibilities. Emily and Victoria have raised valid concerns. Can you provide any additional information or alibis that might alleviate our suspicions?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Of course, Thomas. Last night, I was at the tavern, engaged in conversation with the bartender until the late hours. You can ask anyone there, they'll vouch for me.",
        "Emily:  Benjamin, can anyone at the tavern confirm your whereabouts? It would be helpful to have some witnesses to corroborate your story.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Ah, unfortunately, it seems I was mistaken. It appears there were no witnesses at the tavern last night. However, I assure you, I am innocent. Perhaps we should focus our attention on other potential suspects.",
        "Sophia: \n\nSophia: Benjamin, while your lack of witnesses is concerning, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should consider other possibilities and gather more evidence before making any accusations.",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: Sophia, you make a valid point. Benjamin's lack of a solid alibi is concerning, but we shouldn't rush to judgment. Let's continue gathering information and observing everyone's behavior. There may be subtle clues that can help us uncover the truth.",
        "Victoria: Victoria: I agree with Thomas and Sophia. While Benjamin's lack of an alibi raises some suspicions, we shouldn't rush to judgement. Let's keep a close eye on him, but also remain open to other possibilities. We need more evidence before we can make a decision.",
        "Emily:  While we should definitely keep an eye on Benjamin, I also noticed that Victoria was quite quiet during the discussion. Perhaps she has something to hide as well?",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

Benjamin's lack of an alibi is concerning, and I believe he may be trying to divert attention away from himself. My vote goes to Benjamin."

        "Benjamin: [Oh no, they're already suspicious of me. I need to deflect their attention away.]\n\nBenjamin: Strange? Surely you're mistaken, Emily. I was merely lost in thought.",

Oh, I assure you, Victoria, it's merely my way of coping with such unfortunate events. May I remind you all that pointing fingers without substantial evidence can lead to innocent lives being accused. Let's approach this with caution and reason.",

I need to analyze his behavior more closely.]\n\nThomas: Benjamin, while I appreciate your call for caution, it's also important that we thoroughly investigate all possibilities. Emily and Victoria have raised valid concerns. Can you provide any additional information or alibis that might alleviate our suspicions?",

I should gather more information before making a decision.]\n\nSophia: Benjamin, while your lack of witnesses is concerning, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should consider other possibilities and gather more evidence before making any accusations.",

I need to carefully consider the evidence and my gut feeling before casting my vote.]\n\nThomas: [Victoria seems to be deflecting attention away from herself by pointing fingers at Benjamin.
