        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you all of the loss of Bob, our dear friend. We must now come together and find the creature responsible for this tragedy. I urge everyone to be vigilant and share any suspicions or observations you may have. We cannot afford to let the menace in our midst go unchecked. Let us stand united in our pursuit of justice.",
        "Emily: I can't believe Bob is gone, it's such a tragedy. We need to stay alert and watch out for any suspicious behavior. Let's make sure we all share any suspicions we might have and work together to find the werewolf. We can't let another innocent villager die.",
        "Benjamin: I agree with Thomas and Emily. We must be on high alert and share any suspicions we may have. It's a tragic loss, but we must stay united and find the werewolf before another innocent life is taken. Let's analyze everyone's behavior and look for any inconsistencies or unusual actions.",
        "Sophia: I'm devastated by the loss of Bob. We must remain vigilant and not let our grief cloud our judgment. Let's carefully observe everyone's actions and words. The werewolf is among us, and we must act swiftly to protect ourselves.",
        "Victoria: I share in the sorrow of Bob's loss. It's a difficult time, but we must stay focused on finding the werewolf. We should pay close attention to any sudden changes in behavior or suspicious actions. Let us not be deceived by false innocence.",
        "Benjamin: Indeed, Sophia and Victoria are right. Our grief should not blind us from the task at hand. We must analyze everyone's actions and words with a critical eye. Look for any signs of inconsistency or unusual behavior. Let us not be swayed by false innocence and work together to uncover the true identity of the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: Well said, Benjamin. It is crucial that we remain objective and analyze each other's actions and words carefully. The werewolf is cunning and may try to deceive us, so let us be wary of any sudden changes in behavior or attempts to divert suspicion. We cannot afford to let another innocent life be taken.",
        "Emily: \n\nEmily: I completely agree with all of you. We need to work together and trust each other to uncover the true identity of the werewolf. Benjamin, your analytical skills seem sharp. Perhaps we should team up and share our observations to narrow down the suspects.",
        "Sophia: Absolutely, Emily. It's important that we form alliances and work together to unravel this mystery. Benjamin, I agree with Emily's suggestion. Let's pool our observations and thoughts to help identify the werewolf. We must be thorough and meticulous in our analysis.",
        "Victoria: I see the merit in forming alliances and sharing information. Benjamin, Emily, and Sophia, your suggestions are wise. I am open to collaborating and exchanging thoughts to uncover the truth. Let us be diligent and focused in our pursuit of justice.",
        "Thomas: While forming alliances and sharing information can be valuable, we must also exercise caution. We don't want to inadvertently trust the werewolf or fall into their trap. Let us not forget that the werewolf is cunning and capable of deception. While collaboration is essential, let us also maintain a healthy skepticism and continue to evaluate each other's words and actions critically.",
        "Benjamin: You raise a valid point, Thomas. While collaboration is important, we must also remain cautious. Let us be diligent in our analysis and not blindly trust anyone. We must balance collaboration with critical thinking to ensure we do not fall victim to deception.",
        "Emily: \n\nEmily: I appreciate the cautionary reminder, Thomas and Benjamin. We must strike a balance between collaboration and critical thinking. Let's continue to share our observations, suspicions, and any evidence we may come across. We need to think strategically and remain vigilant in our pursuit of justice.",
        "Sophia: Indeed, Emily. Striking a balance between collaboration and critical thinking is crucial. Let's keep our minds sharp and continue to observe each other's words and actions closely. The werewolf may try to sow doubt and misdirect us, but together, we can unravel their deception and bring them to justice.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Thomas, Benjamin, Emily, and Sophia. Collaboration is important, but we must also maintain a healthy level of skepticism. Let us continue to share our observations and suspicions, but always be mindful of the possibility of deception. We must analyze each other's actions and words with a discerning eye to uncover the true identity of the werewolf.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nBenjamin, your analytical skills have been commendable, and you have been actively contributing to our discussions. However, there have been moments where I noticed a subtle shift in your demeanor, and your arguments seem to be a bit too polished. I am sorry, but my vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Emily: \n\nEmily: \n\nMy vote goes to Victoria.",

I've been actively participating in the discussions, analyzing everyone's actions, and contributing to our collective effort. I believe that voting for me would be a hasty judgment based on assumptions. I urge you to reconsider your vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI vote for Victoria.",
