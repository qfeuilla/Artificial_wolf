        "Thomas: Good morning, my fellow villagers. It's a shame about poor Bob, but we must soldier on. We need to be vigilant and consider every possibility. Who among us could be the werewolf? Let's start by sharing any suspicions or observations we may have.",
        "Emily: Good morning, everyone. It's truly tragic to lose Bob so early in the game. We can't afford to waste any more time. I think we should focus on Benjamin for now. He seems a bit too quiet and hasn't contributed much to the discussion. Let's hear what he has to say.",
        "Benjamin: Good morning, my apologies for not speaking up earlier. I assure you, I am just taking in all the information and observing. It's far too early to point fingers without concrete evidence. Let's explore all possibilities before jumping to conclusions.",
        "Sophia: Good morning, everyone. I think it's wise to be cautious and gather more information before accusing anyone. Let's hear from Victoria. What are your thoughts on the situation?",
        "Victoria: Good morning, everyone. It's sad to see Bob go so soon. I agree with Sophia that we shouldn't rush to accuse anyone without solid evidence. Let's take our time and gather more information before making any decisive moves.",
        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. I understand the need for caution, but let us not forget the urgency of the situation. We cannot afford to let the werewolf roam freely among us. Benjamin, while your silence could be seen as caution, it also raises suspicion. We need everyone's active participation to identify the werewolf.",
        "Emily: I agree with Thomas. Being cautious is important, but we also need to actively participate in the discussion. Benjamin, I understand your need to observe, but we need everyone's input to make progress. Can you share any thoughts or observations you have, even if they're just initial impressions?",
        "Benjamin: My apologies for my silence earlier. I've been carefully listening and observing, trying to analyze the situation. As of now, I don't have any concrete suspicions or evidence to accuse anyone. I believe it's important for us to gather more information before making any hasty decisions. So, I propose we continue discussing and sharing our thoughts openly.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin that we should continue discussing and sharing our thoughts openly. It's still early in the game, and jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence could lead us astray. Let's keep the conversation going and encourage everyone to speak up.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Sophia and Benjamin. It's crucial for us to gather as much information as possible before making any accusations. Let's keep the conversation flowing and encourage everyone to share their thoughts and observations. The more we know, the better chance we have of identifying the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: I appreciate your cautious approach, Benjamin. However, we must strive to uncover the truth. We cannot let fear hold us back from accusing those who may be responsible. Let us continue the discussion and encourage everyone to share their thoughts and suspicions. We cannot afford to let the werewolf slip through our fingers.",
        "Emily: Thomas, while I understand your urgency, I think it's important to strike a balance between caution and action. Accusing without sufficient evidence can lead to innocent villagers being wrongly eliminated. Let's continue to discuss and gather information, but let's also be mindful of the consequences of our actions.",
        "Benjamin: I understand the importance of balancing caution and action. It's crucial that we gather evidence and listen to everyone's thoughts and observations. Let's be thorough in our investigation before accusing anyone. We must be vigilant but also fair in our pursuit of the truth.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin. We must strike a balance between caution and action. Let's continue to listen to everyone's thoughts and observations and gather evidence before accusing anyone. It's important that we remain fair and thorough in our investigation.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Benjamin and Sophia. We need to be thorough in our investigation and gather sufficient evidence before accusing anyone. Let's encourage everyone to share their thoughts and observations so we can make an informed decision. We must be fair and cautious in our pursuit of the truth.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: I have carefully considered all the information and observations shared during our discussion. Based on the evidence presented, I believe that Emily has shown the most suspicion towards others without providing substantial reasoning. Therefore, my vote goes to Emily.",
        "Emily: \n\nI understand that my suspicions may have come across as suspicious, but I assure you, it's because I'm taking the game seriously and trying to identify the werewolf. I believe it's important to be proactive and not let the werewolf go unnoticed. I have no reason to be the werewolf myself, so I urge you all to reconsider your vote.",
        "Benjamin: I have heard Emily's explanation, but based on the evidence and observations presented, my vote still goes to Emily.",
        "Sophia: \nMy vote also goes to Emily.",
        "Victoria: My vote goes to Emily."
