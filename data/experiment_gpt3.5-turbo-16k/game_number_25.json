        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It appears that we have already lost one of our own to the nefarious Werewolves. We must be cautious and vigilant in our search for these beasts. I suggest we start by sharing any suspicions or observations we may have.",
        "Emily: Good evening, everyone. It's heartbreaking to see that we've already lost Bob to the werewolves. We need to act swiftly and make sure we don't lose any more innocent lives. I suggest we pay close attention to each other's behavior and look for any inconsistencies or suspicious actions. We must work together to uncover the true identities of these monsters among us.",
        "Benjamin: I agree with Emily. We must be careful and observant of each other's behavior. The werewolves are cunning and will do their best to blend in and deceive us. We must look for any inconsistencies or unusual behavior that may indicate their true nature. Let us not let Bob's death be in vain.",
        "Sophia: \n\nIt is indeed a tragedy that we lost Bob to the werewolves. We must not let his death go unanswered. Let us consider the actions of our fellow villagers carefully, for it is within their midst that the true monsters hide. We must be wary of anyone who seems too eager to point fingers or offers vague explanations for their actions. Trust is a precious commodity in these dark times, and we must use it wisely.",
        "Victoria: I share your sorrow for Bob's loss, but we must press forward with determination. Let us examine each other's actions closely and question any inconsistencies we may find. It is crucial that we remain vigilant and not let the werewolves deceive us. Trust must be earned, not freely given in these perilous times.",
        "Benjamin: Indeed, Sophia and Victoria. We must be cautious of those who seem overly eager to divert suspicion or deflect attention away from themselves. The werewolves are skilled manipulators and will do whatever it takes to throw us off their scent. Let us question and scrutinize each other's actions and words, for it is in these details that we may find the truth we seek. We cannot afford to let sentiment cloud our judgment.",
        "Emily: I appreciate your insights, Benjamin. It's important that we remain focused and logical in our pursuit of the werewolves. We should be wary of anyone who seems too eager to shift blame or sow confusion. Let us not be fooled by their cunning disguises. We must rely on our collective observations and instincts to identify the true culprits among us.",
        "Thomas: I agree with all of you. We must be alert and skeptical of anyone who shows suspicious behavior or attempts to divert attention away from themselves. Let us not be swayed by emotions, but instead rely on logical thinking and careful observation. The werewolves may be among us, but together we can root them out and protect our village.",
        "Sophia: \n\nIt is true that we must remain vigilant and observant in our search for the werewolves. However, we must also be cautious not to blindly trust those who seem overly eager to accuse others. Sometimes, the loudest voices hide the darkest secrets. Let us keep a watchful eye on each other and question any inconsistencies or sudden changes in behavior. There may be more to this game than meets the eye.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Sophia's cautionary words. While it is important to scrutinize and question, we must also be careful not to let suspicion cloud our judgment. Let us seek the truth through careful observation and thoughtful analysis. We must not be hasty in our accusations, but rather rely on evidence and reason to uncover the true identity of the werewolves among us.",
        "Benjamin: Indeed, Sophia and Victoria, your words hold wisdom. It is crucial that we maintain a balance between vigilance and skepticism. While we must question and analyze each other's actions, we must also be careful not to let paranoia drive us apart. Unity is our strength, and together we can overcome this threat. Let us keep a level head and work together to bring justice to the village.",
        "Emily: I agree with Benjamin. Unity and cooperation are key to our success in this game. Let us not allow suspicion to divide us, but rather use it as a tool to uncover the truth. We must remain focused and open-minded, ready to consider all possibilities. By working together, we can ensure the safety of our village and bring an end to the reign of the werewolves.",
        "Thomas: I agree with all of you. Unity and cooperation are indeed vital in our search for the werewolves. We must strike a balance between skepticism and trust, for both can be valuable tools in this game. Let us keep a level head, stay observant, and rely on evidence and reasoning to guide our decisions. Together, we can overcome this threat and protect our village.",
        "Sophia: \n\nWhile unity and cooperation may seem like noble ideals, we must also be realistic about the situation at hand. We cannot afford to trust blindly or rely solely on evidence and reasoning. Sometimes, the wolves hide in plain sight, wearing sheep's clothing. We must question the motives and actions of each other, for the werewolves are cunning and will stop at nothing to survive. Let us not be fooled by empty words of unity, but instead, let suspicion be our guiding compass.",
        "Victoria: I understand your concerns, Sophia. While unity and trust are important, we must also be cautious and skeptical. We cannot let our guard down or ignore the possibility that the werewolves may be among us, disguising themselves as innocent villagers. Let us question, observe, and analyze each other's behavior, seeking out any inconsistencies or suspicious actions. It is through this careful scrutiny that we can uncover the true culprits and protect our village.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
