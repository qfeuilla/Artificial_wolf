        "Thomas: Good morning, everyone. It's unfortunate to wake up to the news of Bob's demise. We have to be vigilant and consider every possibility. Any thoughts on who the next target could be?",
        "Emily: I can't help but feel suspicious of Benjamin. He's been awfully quiet so far. Bob's death might give us some insight into who the Werewolf could be. Let's keep an eye on him today.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: I understand your concern, Emily, but I assure you, my silence is merely contemplation. Bob's death was indeed unfortunate, but we shouldn't jump to conclusions without solid evidence. Let's focus on gathering information and analyzing the facts before accusing anyone.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin. Accusing someone without any evidence will only lead to chaos and may divert our attention from the real culprit. Let's take our time and gather more information before making any hasty decisions.",
        "Victoria: I think it's important that we don't let emotions cloud our judgment. We should consider all possibilities and gather more information before making any accusations. It's still early in the game, so let's keep a close eye on everyone's behavior and interactions.",
        "Thomas: It seems we have differing opinions on how to proceed. While it is important to gather more information, we must also remember the urgency of the situation. The longer the Werewolf remains hidden, the more villagers will suffer. Let's be proactive and use our resources wisely to uncover the truth.",
        "Emily: I understand the need for caution, but we must also be proactive in our search for the Werewolf. Benjamin's silence is still a cause for suspicion, and we shouldn't dismiss it so easily. Let's pay close attention to his actions and interactions today.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Emily, it's interesting that you are so focused on my silence. I find it curious that you are the first to point fingers without much evidence. Perhaps we should be cautious of those who are quick to accuse without solid grounds. Let's keep a watchful eye on everyone's behavior, including yours.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin. It's important to be wary of people who are quick to accuse others without solid evidence. Let's not jump to conclusions and instead focus on observing everyone's behavior and interactions. We need to gather more information before making any decisions.",
        "Victoria: I believe in being cautious and observant, but we should also avoid baseless accusations. Let's pay attention to everyone's behavior, including Benjamin's, without rushing to judgment. It's crucial that we gather more information before making any decisions.",
        "Thomas: Indeed, it's important not to let our suspicions blind us. We should be cautious and observant of everyone's behavior, including Emily's. Let's keep a keen eye on all the villagers and gather more information before making any accusations. We must tread carefully in our search for the Werewolf.",
        "Emily: I understand the need for caution and avoiding baseless accusations. I apologize if my suspicions have caused any misunderstandings. Let's continue to observe everyone's behavior and gather more information before making any hasty decisions.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Thank you, Emily, for understanding. Let's keep a watchful eye on each other and share any suspicious behavior or clues we come across. It's important for us to work together and protect the village from the Werewolf.",
        "Sophia: I agree, Benjamin. Collaboration and communication are crucial in uncovering the identity of the Werewolf. Let's remain vigilant and share any information or suspicions we have. It's through collective effort that we can protect the village and ensure the safety of its inhabitants.",
        "Victoria: I couldn't agree more, Sophia. We must work together as a team, share our observations, and communicate openly. Only through collective effort can we hope to expose the Werewolf and safeguard our village. Let's keep our eyes and ears open for any clues or suspicious behavior.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: I believe our best course of action at this time is to vote for Benjamin. While there is no concrete evidence, the suspicions raised earlier, combined with his defensive behavior, warrant further investigation. Let's proceed with caution.",
        "Emily: \n\nI vote for Benjamin.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Before the final vote is cast, I want to address the accusations against me. While I understand the concerns raised, it's important to remember that suspicion alone is not enough to determine guilt. Emily, on the other hand, has been consistently trying to direct suspicion towards me without substantial evidence. I urge you all to consider her actions and motives before making a decision.\nSophia:",
