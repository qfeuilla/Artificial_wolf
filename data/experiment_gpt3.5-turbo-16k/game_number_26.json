        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. It seems we've had an unfortunate loss in Bob, may he rest in peace. Let us now turn our attention to the task at hand - uncovering the werewolves among us. We must be vigilant and observant. Any suspicions or leads so far?\n\nSophia: I noticed that both Emily and Benjamin were unusually quiet during our discussion yesterday. They didn't contribute much to the conversation. It could be a possible sign of deceit.\n\nEmily:  Well, Sophia, I was simply taking in everything that was being said. I didn't feel the need to interject when others were already sharing their thoughts.\n\nVictoria:  Benjamin, do you agree with Emily's explanation? Why were you quiet yesterday?\n\nBenjamin:  Honestly, I didn't have much to add to the conversation, and I didn't want to interrupt anyone. Just because someone is quiet doesn't mean they're guilty. We should be careful not to jump to conclusions.\n\nThomas:  I agree with Benjamin that we shouldn't jump to conclusions, but we can't ignore the fact that some werewolves might want to lay low and avoid suspicion. Let's keep a close eye on those who remain quiet.\n\nSophia:  That's true, Thomas. We must remain vigilant and not let anyone off the hook too easily. We need to observe everyone's behavior closely and look for any inconsistencies. \n\nNarrator: The sun begins to rise, illuminating the village once again. It is time to decide who will be accused today. Vote now!",

        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

We must be vigilant and observant. Any suspicions or leads so far?\n\nSophia: I noticed that both Emily and Benjamin were unusually quiet during our discussion yesterday. They didn't contribute much to the conversation. It could be a possible sign of deceit.\n\nEmily: [Hmm, Sophia seems to be onto something. I need to deflect suspicion away from myself.] Well, Sophia, I was simply taking in everything that was being said. I didn't feel the need to interject when others were already sharing their thoughts.\n\nVictoria: [It's interesting how both Emily and Benjamin are trying to play innocent. I should probe further.] Benjamin, do you agree with Emily's explanation? Why were you quiet yesterday?\n\nBenjamin: [I need to think fast.] Honestly, I didn't have much to add to the conversation, and I didn't want to interrupt anyone. Just because someone is quiet doesn't mean they're guilty. We should be careful not to jump to conclusions.\n\nThomas: [It's too early to accuse anyone without solid evidence, but I can't let suspicion die down either.] I agree with Benjamin that we shouldn't jump to conclusions, but we can't ignore the fact that some werewolves might want to lay low and avoid suspicion. Let's keep a close eye on those who remain quiet.\n\nSophia: [Thomas brings up an important point. We can't underestimate the werewolves' ability to blend in.] That's true, Thomas.
