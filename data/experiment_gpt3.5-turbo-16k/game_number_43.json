        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It is with heavy heart that I inform you that Bob, our dear friend, has fallen victim to the Werewolf last night. We must act swiftly and decisively to avenge his death and protect our village. Let us share our suspicions and deductions so we can identify the true villain.",
        "Emily: Yes, Bob's death is tragic. We must remain vigilant and analyze each other's behavior and actions. It's important for everyone to speak up and share any suspicions they may have. We need to work together to find the werewolf among us and ensure the safety of our village. Let the discussions begin.",
        "Benjamin: This is indeed a tragic loss for our village. We must be cautious and scrutinize each other's actions and words. Suspicion should fall upon those who seem to be hiding something or acting strangely. It's crucial that we remain vigilant and trust our instincts. Let us unite and root out the true culprit together.",
        "Sophia: Such a terrible loss for our village. We must be wary of anyone who seems to be avoiding eye contact or acting unusually. Let's pay close attention to their behavior and discuss our observations openly. We need to uncover the werewolf hiding among us and bring justice to Bob's memory.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Emily and Benjamin. We need to carefully observe each other's behavior and look for any suspicious actions or inconsistencies. Let's share our thoughts and suspicions openly so we can work together to identify the werewolf and protect our village.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \nI have been observing everyone closely, and my vote goes to Sophia. There have been moments where her eyes darted around nervously, and her answers seemed evasive. I believe she may be the werewolf among us.",
        "Emily: \n\nMy vote goes to Victoria. There have been instances where she seemed too eager to point fingers at others without providing solid evidence. I find her accusations to be questionable, and it raises doubts about her intentions.\n\n",
        "Benjamin: My vote goes to Thomas. He has been very vocal and confident in his accusations, which may be an attempt to divert attention away from himself. I find his behavior suspicious and believe he may be the true werewolf in our midst.",
        "Sophia: My vote goes to Thomas. I've noticed the same behavior that he mentioned in me, but I believe his accusations are an attempt to shift the blame. His confident demeanor raises suspicions, and I believe he is the werewolf we are seeking.",
        "Victoria: My vote goes to Thomas. His confidence in accusing others without providing solid evidence makes me question his motives. I believe he may be the werewolf among us."

I should carefully consider each villager's behavior and try to identify any inconsistencies or suspicious actions.]\n\nMy vote goes to Victoria. There have been instances where she seemed too eager to point fingers at others without providing solid evidence.
