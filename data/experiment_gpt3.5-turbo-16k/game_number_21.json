        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. It appears that we have lost poor Bob to the Werewolf's wrath. We must act swiftly and cautiously today. Let us share our suspicions and observations to root out the true culprit. Who among us seems the most suspicious?",
        "Emily:  I noticed Benjamin was acting quite nervous yesterday, avoiding eye contact and fidgeting. Perhaps we should start by questioning him?",
        "Benjamin:  I understand your concern, Emily, but nervousness does not prove guilt. In fact, it could be a sign of innocence, as I am genuinely worried about the safety of our village. Let us not jump to conclusions so quickly. Instead, I suggest we hear from each person and listen to their alibis and observations. We need solid evidence before accusing anyone.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin. It's important to gather more information before pointing fingers. Let's hear from everyone and see if any patterns or inconsistencies emerge.",
        "Victoria: I understand the need for caution, but we cannot afford to waste time. Benjamin's nervousness does raise some concern, but we should hear from others as well. Let's not rule out anyone just yet; the true culprit could be hiding in plain sight. We must observe, listen, and analyze every detail.",
        "Thomas: I must agree with Victoria here. While Benjamin's nervousness is worth noting, we should keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. Let us each share our alibis and any observations we may have from last night. We need to piece together the puzzle to find the true werewolf among us.",
        "Emily:  I appreciate everyone's cautious approach. It's crucial to listen to each other's alibis and observations to gather more information. Let's begin by sharing what we remember from last night.",
        "Benjamin:  Thank you, Emily. I can start by sharing my alibi. Last night, I was at home, reading a book until late. I didn't hear or see anything unusual. I understand my nervousness might have raised suspicion, but I assure you, it's just my concern for the village's safety. Now, who would like to share their alibi and observations?\nVictoria: Benjamin, I appreciate your alibi. It's important that we all have an open mind and consider everyone's perspective. As for myself, I was at the tavern until closing time, chatting with Sophia and Thomas. We saw nothing out of the ordinary. However, I did notice that Sophia seemed quite jumpy and on edge throughout the evening. I think we should hear from her next.\nSophia: Thank you, Victoria, for sharing your alibi. I admit I was a bit anxious last night, but it's because I heard strange noises outside my house. I couldn't see anything when I looked out, so I stayed inside. It's possible that the werewolf was lurking nearby, but I didn't witness anything concrete. Benjamin, what about you? Did you notice anything unusual during the night?\nBenjamin:",
        "Thomas: I apologize for my silence earlier. I was patrolling the outskirts of the village last night, keeping an eye out for any suspicious activity. Unfortunately, I didn't witness anything out of the ordinary. Benjamin, did you notice anything during your late-night reading?",
        "Benjamin: Actually, Thomas, I didn't notice anything unusual during my reading. It was a quiet night, as far as I could tell. No strange noises or movements. It seems like we're all in the dark about what happened last night. We need to be cautious, but also proactive in uncovering the truth. Let's continue sharing our alibis and observations, and see if any patterns start to emerge.",
        "Emily:  Thank you for sharing, Benjamin and Sophia. I appreciate your honesty. Let's hear from Emily and then we can discuss further.",
        "Emily:  Thank you all for sharing your alibis and observations. Last night, I was at home, unable to sleep due to the recent events. I didn't hear or see anything unusual either. It seems like we are all unsure of what happened, but we must remain vigilant and gather more information.",
        "Thomas: Thank you, Emily, for sharing your alibi. It seems that none of us have concrete evidence or witnessed any suspicious activity last night. However, we should not let this discourage us. Let's continue to keep a close eye on each other, paying attention to any changes in behavior or unusual patterns. By working together, we can unravel the identity of the werewolf among us.",
        "Victoria: Indeed, Thomas. We cannot let uncertainty paralyze us. We must stay vigilant and observant, looking for any subtle signs or inconsistencies. Let's continue to share any additional information or suspicions that may arise, keeping an open mind and considering all possibilities. The more we share and analyze, the closer we'll come to uncovering the true werewolf.",
        "Sophia: Thank you all for sharing your alibis and observations. It seems we are all equally unsure and lack concrete evidence. However, we cannot let this discourage us. Let's continue to stay vigilant and observant, looking for any signs or inconsistencies. The werewolf is among us, and we must work together to expose them.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: After careful consideration, my vote goes to Benjamin. Although his alibi seems plausible, his nervousness and desire for caution raise some suspicion. We must trust our instincts, and for now, they lead me to believe that Benjamin may be the werewolf among us.",
        "Emily:  I agree with Thomas. My vote also goes to Benjamin.",
        "Benjamin:  It seems I've become the target of suspicion. I understand your concerns, but I assure you, I am not the werewolf. My nervousness is simply a result of the tense situation we find ourselves in. I have done nothing to warrant your mistrust. I urge you all to reconsider and vote for someone else.",
        "Sophia: My vote goes to Benjamin. While I acknowledge his alibi, his consistent nervousness and defensive response to the accusations raise doubts in my mind. It's better to err on the side of caution and eliminate a potential threat to the village.",
