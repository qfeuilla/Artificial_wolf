        "Thomas: Such a tragic loss, poor Bob. We must act swiftly to avenge him. I suggest we start by sharing our suspicions. Who among us could be capable of such savagery?",
        "Emily: \nEmily: Yes, it is truly tragic. We must remain vigilant and consider every possibility. We should not overlook anyone, as the werewolf could be hiding in plain sight.",
        "Benjamin: I agree with Thomas and Emily. We must be cautious and not jump to conclusions. Let's hear from everyone before making any decisions.",
        "Sophia: I couldn't agree more. It's important that we remain open-minded and consider all possibilities before pointing fingers. Let's hear from everyone and gather as much information as we can before making any decisions.",
        "Victoria: Absolutely, we need to approach this with a level head. Let's not rush to accuse anyone without proper evidence. It would be wise to hear everyone's thoughts and observations before making any decisions.",
        "Thomas: I appreciate your cautious approach, but we also can't afford to waste time. We must act swiftly to protect our village. Let's start by sharing any suspicious behavior or odd occurrences that we've noticed.",
        "Emily: \nEmily: While I understand the need for caution, we must not forget the urgency of the situation. The longer we wait, the more lives are at risk. We need to be proactive in identifying the werewolf, rather than wasting time in endless deliberation.",
        "Benjamin: I see your point, Emily. Time is of the essence, and we must take action. However, we must also be careful not to accuse innocent villagers. Let's start by sharing any unusual behavior or inconsistencies we've noticed. We can then analyze the information and make an informed decision.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin. It's important that we act with a sense of urgency, but we must also be thorough in our investigation. Let's gather information on any unusual behavior or inconsistencies, and then use that as a basis for our decision-making process. Rushing without proper evidence could lead us astray.",
        "Victoria: I understand the need for urgency, but we must also remember that hasty decisions can lead to unintended consequences. Let's be diligent and thorough in our investigation, gathering as much information as possible before making any accusations. Rushing may cause us to overlook crucial details.",
        "Thomas: Time is indeed of the essence, but we must strike a balance between urgency and thoroughness. Let's focus on sharing any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies we've observed, and use that as a starting point for our investigation. We can then analyze the information and make a calculated decision. Let's not rush, but let's not waste time either.",
        "Emily: \nEmily: I understand the need for caution, but we cannot afford to let the werewolf roam free any longer. We have to trust our instincts and take action. Suspicion alone won't save us - we need to make a decision and eliminate someone. It's a risk we must take to protect the village.",
        "Benjamin: I understand the urgency, Emily, but we must strike a balance between caution and action. Let's take a moment to gather information and hear from everyone. Rushing into a decision without solid evidence could lead to innocent villagers being eliminated. We must analyze the information carefully before making a decision that affects someone's life.",
        "Sophia: I understand the weight of the situation, and while urgency is important, we must also exercise caution. It's crucial that we gather as much information as possible and consider all perspectives before making any accusations. Let's focus on sharing any suspicious behavior or discrepancies we've noticed, and then proceed with a thoughtful and informed decision-making process.",

Rushing into a decision without considering all perspectives and gathering sufficient information can lead to unintended consequences.

        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

Emily seems to be advocating for a more proactive approach, which could be a sign of her trying to divert attention. Benjamin has been cautious and level-headed throughout the discussion, but he also voted for Victoria. Victoria has been advocating for thoroughness and caution, which are important qualities, but that could also be a clever way to divert suspicion. Based on the information, I think my vote will go to Emily.]\n\nMy vote goes to Emily.",
