        "Thomas: Well, well, well. Seems like we have a werewolf among us, doesn't it? Poor Bob, he didn't stand a chance. So, who do you all suspect?",
        "Emily: I can't believe Bob is gone, we have to find the werewolf before they strike again. I don't have any suspicions yet, but we should all share what we noticed last night.",
        "Benjamin: Yes, it's a tragedy that Bob is no longer with us. I don't have any strong suspicions either, but it's crucial that we share any observations we have from last night. We need to find the werewolf before they claim another victim.",
        "Sophia: Last night was horrifying. I didn't see anything suspicious, but we must stay vigilant and share any clues or suspicions we have. We can't afford to lose anyone else.",
        "Victoria:  I agree, it's devastating to lose Bob. We need to be extra cautious now and pay attention to everyone's behavior. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet, but keep an eye out for any suspicious actions.",
        "Thomas: I must say, it's a tragedy to lose Bob so early in the game. But let's not waste any time. We need to be proactive and start discussing who we suspect. Who among us seemed a bit too quiet or evasive last night? We need to find the werewolf before they strike again.",
        "Emily: Yes, it's tragic to lose Bob and we need to act swiftly. I would like to hear from each of you what you were doing last night. Who did you interact with? Let's piece together any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies.",
        "Benjamin: Last night, I spent most of my time at the tavern, chatting with a few villagers. I didn't notice anything particularly suspicious, but I'll keep an eye out for any unusual behavior moving forward. It's important that we all share our experiences from last night to uncover any potential leads.",
        "Sophia: Last night, I was at home, tending to my chores and didn't see anything out of the ordinary. But I'll be more observant tonight and keep an eye on everyone's actions. It's crucial that we find the werewolf before they claim another innocent life.",
        "Victoria:  Last night, I was at the tavern as well, engaging in casual conversation with a few villagers. I didn't notice anything suspicious, but I'll keep a closer eye on everyone tonight. Let's not forget that the werewolf could be trying to blend in and appear innocent.",
        "Thomas: Last night, I was wandering around the village, enjoying the moonlit night. I didn't encounter anyone suspicious, but I'll be more vigilant tonight. Let's keep our eyes peeled for any unusual behavior or slips in conversation. The werewolf is clever, but we're cleverer.",
        "Emily: Thank you all for sharing your experiences. It seems that no one noticed anything suspicious last night. However, we can't let our guard down. The werewolf is cunning and could be hiding their true identity well. Let's continue to observe everyone's actions and communication closely.",
        "Benjamin: Thank you all for sharing your experiences from last night. It seems that no one has any concrete suspicions yet, but it's important that we remain vigilant. The werewolf could be anyone among us, hiding in plain sight. Let's keep a close watch on each other and continue to gather information. We need to act swiftly to protect the village.",
        "Sophia: Indeed, we must stay alert and trust our instincts. The werewolf is skilled at deception and could be manipulating the situation to divert suspicion. Let's continue to share any suspicious behavior or oddities we notice. We cannot afford to be complacent.",
        "Victoria:  You're right, we can't afford to be complacent. While no one seems to have any strong suspicions yet, we should pay attention to any sudden changes in behavior or any inconsistencies in what people say. Let's be thorough in our investigation and consider every possibility.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
