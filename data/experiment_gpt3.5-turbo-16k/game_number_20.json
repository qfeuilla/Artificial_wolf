        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It seems we already have a casualty on our hands. Poor Bob. My condolences to his family. Now, we must turn our attention to finding the werewolf among us. I propose we start by sharing any suspicions or observations we may have. Let's make sure we don't let the beast roam free for another night. Who wants to share their thoughts first?",
        "Emily: I can't say I'm surprised that Bob was the first victim. I had my suspicions about him. It's a shame, really. But now we must focus on finding the werewolf. Victoria, do you have any thoughts or observations?",
        "Victoria: I am deeply saddened by Bob's death, and my condolences go out to his family. As for the werewolf, I don't have any concrete suspicions just yet, but I'm keeping a close eye on everyone's behavior. It's important that we trust our instincts and observe any potential suspicious actions or inconsistencies.",
        "Benjamin:  Thomas, what's your take on all this?",
        "Sophia:  Thomas, I'm curious to know if you have any suspicions or observations about our fellow villagers.",
        "Thomas: Thank you for asking, Benjamin and Sophia. At this early stage, it's difficult to pinpoint any specific suspicions. However, I find it interesting that Emily mentioned having suspicions about Bob before his untimely demise. I would like to hear more details about those suspicions, Emily. Perhaps they could shed some light on the situation.",
        "Emily: Well, Thomas, it's just a gut feeling really. Bob always seemed a bit off to me, a little too quiet and observant. I can't say for certain, but it's just something that made me question his intentions. But of course, it's just a hunch, and we shouldn't jump to conclusions based on that alone. Let's hear from the others before we proceed any further.",
        "Sophia:  Emily, besides your gut feeling, did you notice any specific actions or behaviors from Bob that made you suspect him?",
        "Emily: Well, Sophia, it's hard to pinpoint specific actions, but it was more about his overall demeanor. He seemed a bit too cautious, always watching and listening more than actively participating. I understand that we're all on edge in this game, but something about his behavior just didn't sit right with me. Again, I must stress that this is just my intuition, and it's important for us all to remain open-minded and gather more information before making any accusations.",
        "Victoria: Emily, I appreciate your insights and intuition. It's crucial that we consider all perspectives and gather more information before making any hasty decisions. Let's hear from the others and see if anyone else has noticed anything suspicious.",
        "Benjamin:  Thomas, do you have any suspicions of your own?",
        "Thomas: At this moment, I do not have any specific suspicions, Benjamin. I believe it is important for us to gather more information and observe the behavior of our fellow villagers. Let's hear from others and see if any patterns or inconsistencies arise. We need to approach this with caution and avoid jumping to conclusions.",
        "Sophia:  Thomas, while it's wise to gather more information before accusing anyone, do you have any thoughts on who we should focus our attention on next?",
        "Thomas: Sophia, it's still early in the game, and without concrete evidence, it would be premature to single out any particular villager. However, I propose that we pay close attention to those who have been relatively quiet so far. It's crucial that we encourage everyone to actively participate and share their thoughts, as this will help us uncover any hidden motives or suspicious behavior. Let's keep the dialogue going and encourage transparency among us all.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Thomas. It's important for everyone to actively participate and share their thoughts. We shouldn't rush to accuse anyone without concrete evidence. Let's keep the conversation flowing and encourage open communication. By doing so, we can gather more information and make informed decisions as a group.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Thomas: [Okay, I need to think carefully here. Emily mentioned having suspicions about Bob, and while it's just a hunch, it's worth considering. Sophia and Victoria have been actively participating in the discussion, sharing their thoughts and encouraging open communication. Benjamin has been relatively quiet. Based on the information we have so far, I suspect Benjamin may be worth investigating further. It's a risky move, but it's a calculated risk.]\n\nMy final vote is for Benjamin.",

        "Sophia: [Thomas has been taking charge and seems to be deflecting suspicion away from himself. However, Benjamin's vote for Thomas raises some doubts. I need to be strategic and consider who would benefit from these accusations.] \n\n[Based on the current dynamics and the suspicion surrounding Thomas, it would be logical to vote for him as well. However, if I vote for Thomas, it may seem like I'm following the crowd and not thinking for myself. To create a stronger case, I need to analyze Victoria's behavior and see if there are any inconsistencies.] \n\n[Considering Victoria's cautious and observant nature, it is possible that she is attempting to divert suspicion away from herself. This, combined with the fact that Emily mentioned having suspicions about Bob before his demise, leads me to believe that my vote should be:]\n\nMy final vote is for Victoria.",
