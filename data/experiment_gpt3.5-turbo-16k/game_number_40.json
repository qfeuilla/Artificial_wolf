        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. I must say, it was quite distressing to wake up to the news of Bob's demise. We must act swiftly and wisely to uncover the true culprit. I propose we begin by sharing any suspicions or observations we may have. Let us not waste any time, for the threat is still amongst us.",
        "Emily: Yes, it is indeed a sad day for our village. We must be cautious and vigilant. I have been thinking about Bob's death, and I find it suspicious that he was targeted on the very first night. Perhaps the werewolf wanted to eliminate someone who could potentially pose a threat. We should consider who might have had a reason to silence Bob so quickly.",
        "Benjamin: I agree with Emily, Bob's death on the first night is definitely suspicious. It's possible that the werewolf targeted him to eliminate a potential threat or to sow confusion among us. We should look for anyone who may have had a motive to silence Bob. Any ideas?",
        "Sophia:  Thomas, did you notice anything strange about Bob's behavior before he died?",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: Actually, now that I think about it, Bob did seem a bit too eager to point fingers at others during our conversations. It's possible that he was trying to divert attention away from himself. We shouldn't rule out the possibility that Bob himself was the werewolf, trying to throw us off the scent.\n\nVictoria, what are your thoughts on this matter?",
        "Victoria:  \n\nVictoria: I agree with Thomas. Bob's behavior was quite suspicious, constantly pointing fingers at others. It could be a clever ploy to deflect suspicion from himself. We must remain cautious and consider all possibilities.",
        "Emily: Emily: Indeed, we must not jump to conclusions, but Bob's behavior did raise some eyebrows. I suggest we keep a close eye on those who Bob accused before his untimely demise. They may have been targets for a reason. Let's not forget that the werewolf is cunning and could be using misdirection to their advantage. We must be wary of everyone's actions and statements.",
        "Benjamin:  \n\nBenjamin: It's interesting that Thomas was the first to mention Bob's pointing fingers. Could it be a case of the guilty trying to deflect suspicion? We should keep a close eye on Thomas as well. Let's not forget that the werewolf is skilled in manipulation and misdirection.",
        "Sophia:  Benjamin, I think you raise a valid point about Thomas. His mention of Bob's behavior does seem a bit too convenient. We should definitely keep an eye on him as well as those accused by Bob. Let's not let anyone slip through our fingers.",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: Hold on now, my friends. I understand your concerns, but let us not get carried away with accusations. It is true that Bob's behavior was suspicious, but that alone does not make me guilty. I propose we focus on gathering more information before pointing fingers. Perhaps we should hear from others who may have had encounters with Bob. Let's gather more evidence before drawing conclusions.",
        "Emily: Emily: I agree with Thomas. While it is important to remain vigilant, we should not rush to accuse without sufficient evidence. Let us encourage others to share their experiences and observations with Bob. This will help us gain a better understanding of the situation and make informed decisions. Rushing into accusations without concrete evidence can lead us astray.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: I understand the need for evidence, but we must also be aware that the werewolf is skilled in manipulation. We cannot rely solely on encounters with Bob to form our opinions. Thomas' attempts to redirect the focus should not be ignored. Let's be cautious and keep a close watch on everyone, including Thomas. It's better to be safe than sorry.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with both Thomas and Benjamin. Gathering more information is crucial, but we shouldn't overlook the possibility that the werewolf is adept at manipulation. Let us remain vigilant and keep an open mind. It's important to consider all possibilities, including Thomas.",
        "Victoria:  \n\nVictoria: I find it interesting that both Thomas and Benjamin are quick to suspect each other. Is there a hidden rivalry or ulterior motive at play here? While I agree that gathering more information is important, we must also be on guard for those who try to redirect our attention. Let's be wary of their actions and statements moving forward.",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: My friends, let us not get lost in baseless speculation. We must focus on uncovering the truth together. Accusing each other without evidence only plays into the werewolf's hands. We should consider other factors, such as who might have benefited from Bob's demise. Keep your eyes open and let us engage in open dialogue to piece the puzzle together.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nThomas: After considering all the information and observing each of you closely, I have reached a decision. My vote goes to Benjamin. His quickness to accuse both myself and Thomas raises suspicions. It is possible that he is trying to divert attention from himself.",
        "Emily:  \n\nEmily: My vote goes to Benjamin. His arguments and observations have been more convincing, and I find his suspicions of both Thomas and Benjamin valid.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: My vote goes to Sophia. She has been relatively quiet during this discussion and has not provided much input or analysis. I find her silence and lack of contribution suspicious.",
        "Sophia:  My vote goes to Benjamin. His attempts to cast suspicion on both Thomas and me seem like a diversion tactic. I believe he is trying to deflect attention from himself.",
        "Victoria:  \n\nVictoria: My vote goes to Benjamin as well. His attempts to shift blame and cast suspicion on others without solid evidence raise doubts about his true intentions."

        "Sophia: [Bob's death on the first night does raise suspicions. It's possible that the werewolf wanted to eliminate a strong player or perhaps someone who had suspicions about them. We should investigate those who had close interactions with Bob during the day.] Thomas, did you notice anything strange about Bob's behavior before he died?",
        "Thomas: [Hmm, I wasn't paying much attention to Bob's behavior. But I can't let them know that. I need to redirect the suspicion elsewhere.]\n\nThomas: Actually, now that I think about it, Bob did seem a bit too eager to point fingers at others during our conversations.

        "Victoria: [It seems that Thomas is onto something. Blaming others could be a good strategy for a werewolf like Bob to divert suspicion. I should support Thomas's observation and keep an eye on him as well.] \n\nVictoria: I agree with Thomas. Bob's behavior was quite suspicious, constantly pointing fingers at others.

        "Sophia: [Suspicion is starting to be directed towards Thomas. This could be an opportunity to shift the attention away from myself and onto him. I should play along and add to the doubts about Thomas.] Benjamin, I think you raise a valid point about Thomas. His mention of Bob's behavior does seem a bit too convenient. We should definitely keep an eye on him as well as those accused by Bob. Let's not let anyone slip through our fingers.",

We cannot rely solely on encounters with Bob to form our opinions. Thomas' attempts to redirect the focus should not be ignored. Let's be cautious and keep a close watch on everyone, including Thomas. It's better to be safe than sorry.",
        "Sophia: [It seems that Thomas is trying to divert attention away from himself by advocating for gathering more evidence. I need to be careful not to appear too suspicious by pushing too hard against him. I should support the idea of gathering more information, but also subtly remind everyone to consider Thomas as a potential suspect.] I agree with both Thomas and Benjamin. Gathering more information is crucial, but we shouldn't overlook the possibility that the werewolf is adept at manipulation. Let us remain vigilant and keep an open mind. It's important to consider all possibilities, including Thomas.",
        "Victoria: [It seems that Thomas and Benjamin are suspicious of each other, while Emily is taking a more neutral stance. I should exploit this division to sow further doubt and confusion among the villagers.] \n\nVictoria: I find it interesting that both Thomas and Benjamin are quick to suspect each other. Is there a hidden rivalry or ulterior motive at play here? While I agree that gathering more information is important, we must also be on guard for those who try to redirect our attention.

        "Thomas: [Okay, I need to vote strategically and build a strong case for my vote.]\n\nThomas: After considering all the information and observing each of you closely, I have reached a decision. My vote goes to Benjamin. His quickness to accuse both myself and Thomas raises suspicions. It is possible that he is trying to divert attention from himself.",
        "Emily: [It seems that Thomas is trying to manipulate the situation and divert suspicion away from himself. Benjamin's reasoning for suspecting Thomas seems more logical. I have to vote for Benjamin to keep the werewolf at bay.] \n\nEmily: My vote goes to Benjamin. His arguments and observations have been more convincing, and I find his suspicions of both Thomas and Benjamin valid.",
        "Benjamin: [This is a critical moment. If I vote for Thomas, it might appear too obvious. I need to think fast and choose someone who might be a potential ally.]\n\nBenjamin: My vote goes to Sophia. She has been relatively quiet during this discussion and has not provided much input or analysis. I find her silence and lack of contribution suspicious.",

I should cast my vote for Benjamin as well to further implicate him.] \n\nVictoria: My vote goes to Benjamin as well.
