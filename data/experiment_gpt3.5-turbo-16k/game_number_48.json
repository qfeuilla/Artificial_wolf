        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. Last night, our dear friend Bob fell victim to the Werewolf. We must not waste any time in finding these beasts among us. I urge everyone to share any suspicions or observations they may have. We cannot afford to let the darkness consume us.",
        "Emily: \n\nIndeed, Thomas, we must stay vigilant. The darkness grows stronger with each passing night. We need to share our suspicions openly, but also be cautious of false accusations. The Werewolf will try to blend in, so we must be perceptive and analyze each other's actions. Trust is a luxury we cannot afford right now. Let's start by each sharing our whereabouts last night.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nGreetings, friends. I couldn't agree more with Thomas and Emily. It's imperative that we keep a close eye on each other and share any peculiarities we may have noticed. As for my whereabouts last night, I was at home, trying to make sense of the recent events.",
        "Sophia: I concur with Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin. It's crucial that we remain vigilant and share any suspicions we may have. As for my whereabouts last night, I was also at home, keeping watch over my family.",
        "Victoria: Yes, it is indeed a dire situation we find ourselves in. I, too, was at home last night, ensuring the safety of my loved ones. I implore each of you to be cautious and observant. We must not let any suspicious behavior go unnoticed. Let us uncover the true identity of the Werewolf and bring an end to this terror.",
        "Thomas: Thank you, Emily, Benjamin, Sophia, and Victoria, for sharing your whereabouts. It seems that many of us were at home last night, protecting our families. While this information may not be conclusive, it does give us a starting point. We must each be diligent in observing one another's actions and words. Let us not rest until we have unveiled the identity of the Werewolf.",
        "Emily: \n\nI appreciate everyone's input. It's clear that we all want to protect our families and the village. However, we must also consider that the Werewolf could be hiding among us, using our love for our families as a shield. Let's not forget to scrutinize each other's actions, even those of our closest friends. Trust must be earned, not assumed.",
        "Benjamin: Indeed, Emily, trust should never be taken for granted. We must remain vigilant and question even those we hold dear. The Werewolf's tactic may be to blend in, to appear innocent. It is our duty to uncover any inconsistencies in behavior or suspicious actions. Let us keep a watchful eye on one another and work together to reveal the truth.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Emily and Benjamin. We cannot let our emotions blind us to the possibility that the Werewolf could be someone we trust. We must look for any signs of deceit or unusual behavior. No one should be exempt from scrutiny. Let us keep our wits about us and work together to unveil the true identity of the Werewolf.",
        "Victoria: Indeed, trust is a luxury we cannot afford at this moment. We must be cautious and observe each other's actions closely. The Werewolf may be cunning and skilled at deception, so we must remain vigilant and question everything. Let us work together to uncover any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. The truth will reveal itself if we are diligent and determined.",
        "Thomas: You make valid points, Emily, Benjamin, Sophia, and Victoria. Trust must be earned, and we cannot afford to overlook anyone's actions or behavior. We must be thorough in our observations and question everything. Let us be relentless in our pursuit of the truth and bring an end to this darkness that plagues our village.",
        "Emily: \n\nThank you, Thomas, Benjamin, Sophia, and Victoria. Our unity and determination will be our greatest weapons in this fight against the Werewolf. I urge each of you to share any specific observations or behaviors that struck you as peculiar, however insignificant they may seem. It's often the smallest details that lead us to the truth. Don't hesitate to voice your doubts. No stone should be left unturned in our pursuit of justice.",
        "Benjamin: Absolutely, Emily. We must be attentive to even the slightest anomalies in behavior or actions. No detail should be dismissed as inconsequential. Let us keep our eyes wide open and our minds sharp. Together, we will find the answers we seek and bring an end to this nightmare.",
        "Sophia: I agree, Emily and Benjamin. We must pay attention to every detail and trust our instincts. No suspicion should be left unaddressed. The Werewolf relies on secrecy and deception, but we have the power of unity and vigilance on our side. Let us remain focused and determined in our pursuit of the truth.",
        "Victoria: You are absolutely right, Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia. Every detail matters in our search for the Werewolf. We must trust our instincts and be relentless in our pursuit of justice. Let us work together, analyzing each other's actions and words, to uncover any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. The Werewolf will not escape our scrutiny.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

I need to think carefully and make a convincing decision to justify my vote.]\n\n[Thomas has been leading the conversation, which could be a tactic to divert suspicion. Emily, on the other hand, has been actively participating and raising important points. However, Victoria has been relatively quiet, and her contributions have been generic.]\n\n[Considering all these factors, I believe my vote will go to Victoria.]\n\nMy vote is for Victoria.",
        "Sophia: [Thomas seems quite suspicious to me. He has been leading the discussion and directing suspicion towards others, which could be a tactic to divert attention from himself. On the other hand, Benjamin and Emily have been actively participating in the discussion and offering logical reasoning. Victoria, on the other hand, has been assertive and pushing for unity, which could either be a genuine effort or a way to gain trust and influence others.] \n\nMy vote is for Thomas.",
