        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It seems we have a dangerous werewolf among us. We must act swiftly and decisively to protect the village. Who do you suspect of being the beast? Let us discuss and find a solution together.",
        "Emily: Good evening, everyone. It's a shame that Bob was taken from us, but we must focus on finding the werewolf. Thomas, I appreciate your leadership, but let's not forget that the most cunning werewolves often hide in plain sight. I think we should be cautious of those who are too eager to point fingers.",
        "Benjamin:  I agree with Emily. We shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly. Let's take our time to gather information and observe everyone's behavior before making any accusations.",
        "Sophia: I understand the need for caution, Benjamin, but we also can't afford to be complacent. We've already lost one villager, and we can't risk losing more. Let's hear from everyone and see if there are any suspicious behaviors or inconsistencies that we can discuss further.",
        "Victoria: Good evening, everyone. It is indeed unfortunate that we lost Bob, but we must remain vigilant. I suggest we start by sharing any suspicions or strange behavior we have noticed during the day. Let us gather as much information as possible before making any hasty decisions.",
        "Thomas: Thank you all for your thoughts. I understand the need for caution, but we also cannot afford to be paralyzed by indecision. Let us each share what we have observed and any suspicions we may have. We must work together to identify and eliminate the werewolf before more lives are lost.",
        "Emily: Indeed, Thomas. We need to strike a balance between caution and action. It's important for each of us to share any observations or suspicions we have, no matter how small they may seem. Let's not overlook any details that could lead us to the werewolf.",
        "Benjamin:  I have noticed that Thomas has been quite vocal since the beginning. While it can be a sign of leadership, it's also worth considering if he's trying to divert attention from himself. Let's proceed with caution and consider all possibilities.",
        "Sophia: I agree, Benjamin. It's important to carefully consider everyone's behavior and not overlook any potential clues. Thomas, while your leadership is appreciated, we should also examine your actions and statements closely to ensure that we're not being deceived. We must keep an open mind and explore all possibilities.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Benjamin and Sophia. While Thomas has taken up a leadership role, it is important that we do not blindly follow. Let us examine his actions and statements carefully, as well as those of others, to uncover any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior that may lead us to the werewolf.",
        "Thomas: I understand your concerns, but let us not forget that suspicion alone does not make one guilty. We must remain objective and consider all possibilities. I have taken on a leadership role to bring us together and keep the discussion focused. Let us continue to share our observations and gather more information before making any accusations.",
        "Emily: I see the points being made, but we should also be mindful that the werewolf may be playing a clever game, hiding in plain sight while diverting suspicion onto others. Let's not solely focus on one person, but rather analyze the actions and behaviors of everyone. We must be thorough in our investigation to ensure we find the true culprit.",
        "Benjamin:  I agree with Emily. It's important to consider everyone's actions and behaviors. Let's not get fixated on one person, but instead, observe everyone closely and gather more information before making any hasty decisions. Our village's safety depends on it.",
        "Sophia: You make valid points, Emily and Benjamin. We must cast a wide net and consider all possibilities. It's crucial that we scrutinize the actions and behaviors of each villager to uncover any inconsistencies or suspicious patterns. Let us be thorough and meticulous in our investigation to ensure we don't overlook any potential leads.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia. We should cast a wide net and carefully observe everyone's actions and behaviors. Let us not rush to judgment, but instead gather more information and analyze it meticulously. The safety of our village depends on our thorough investigation.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: I have observed the behaviors and actions of each villager closely. After careful consideration, my vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Emily: I have also been observing everyone closely, and my vote aligns with Thomas. My vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Benjamin:  While I understand the concerns, I believe we should consider Thomas as well. His strong defense and leadership position could be a clever disguise to divert attention. My vote goes to Thomas.",
        "Sophia: I have been observing the interactions and behaviors of everyone, and while it's a difficult decision, my vote also goes to Thomas.",
        "Victoria: I have also observed the actions and behaviors of each villager, and my vote aligns with Benjamin. My vote goes to Benjamin."

        "Benjamin: [Hmm, it's quite early to start pointing fingers, but Emily does bring up a good point. The werewolf might be trying to divert attention by being overly eager to accuse others. I should keep an eye on those who seem too eager to cast blame.] I agree with Emily. We shouldn't jump to conclusions too quickly.
