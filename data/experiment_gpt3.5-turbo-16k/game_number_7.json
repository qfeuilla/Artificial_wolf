        "Thomas: Oh, what a tragic loss. Rest in peace, Bob. We must find the one responsible for this heinous act. Let us investigate our fellow villagers and speak up if anything seems suspicious. We cannot afford to be complacent.",
        "Emily: I agree with Thomas. We need to be vigilant and not let this incident go unnoticed. We must rely on each other to root out the source of this evil. Let us share our thoughts and suspicions openly.",
        "Benjamin: Yes, this is a terrible loss for our village. We must remain alert and observant to uncover the identity of the culprit. We should listen carefully to each other's opinions and look for any inconsistencies or unusual behavior. Let us not jump to conclusions, but rather gather evidence before making any accusations.",
        "Sophia: I couldn't agree more, Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin. We must be cautious and thorough in our investigation. Let us examine each other's actions and words carefully, for the answers may lie hidden within. Suspicion will be our guide, but we must also be wary of false leads and misdirection. Let us be united in our pursuit of justice.",
        "Victoria: Yes, indeed. We must not let fear cloud our judgment. It is crucial that we remain logical and unbiased in our search for the truth. Let us scrutinize everyone's actions and statements, for the smallest clue could lead us to the werewolf. We must work together and trust our instincts to protect our village from further harm.",
        "Thomas: Indeed, Victoria. Trusting our instincts and working together is key. Let us each present our thoughts on who we find suspicious and discuss any inconsistencies or odd behavior we have noticed. We must act swiftly, for the safety of our village depends on it.",
        "Emily: I have been observing closely, and I must say that I find Thomas's behavior slightly suspicious. He seems to be taking charge of the situation a little too quickly. Perhaps he is trying to divert our attention away from himself. I think we should keep a close eye on him during the next day.",
        "Benjamin:  \n\nI agree, Emily. Thomas's eagerness to take charge could be a sign of guilt. Let us keep a watchful eye on him and see if any further evidence arises. We cannot afford to overlook any potential threats to our village's safety.",
        "Sophia: I also find Thomas's behavior concerning. His eagerness to lead the discussion and take charge raises suspicions. I believe we should focus our attention on him and gather more evidence before making any conclusions. Let us observe his actions closely during the day and see if any more clues surface.",
        "Victoria: I too have noticed Thomas's assertiveness and it does raise some doubts. However, let us not jump to conclusions just yet. We should give Thomas a chance to defend himself and provide any explanations for his behavior. It is important to maintain a fair and balanced approach to our investigation. Let us gather more evidence and discuss further before making any decisions.",
        "Thomas: I understand your concerns, but I assure you that my eagerness to take charge comes from a place of genuine concern for our village's safety. I am willing to cooperate fully and provide any explanations necessary. I urge you all to focus on gathering evidence and observing the actions of others as well. Let us work together to uncover the truth and protect our village.",
        "Emily: While Thomas's explanation seems plausible, we should still remain vigilant and not dismiss our suspicions entirely. Let us continue to observe and gather more evidence before making any final judgments. It is important that we consider all possibilities and not overlook any potential threats to our village.",
        "Benjamin:  \n\nIndeed, Thomas's assurance is commendable, but we must remain cautious. It is in the nature of the werewolf to deceive and manipulate. Let us not forget the tragedy that befell us last night. We cannot afford to let our guard down. I propose that we continue to closely observe Thomas's actions and words throughout the day. We must be thorough in our investigation to ensure the safety of our village.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin. While Thomas's explanation is reasonable, we cannot let our guard down. The werewolf is cunning and will do whatever it takes to avoid suspicion. Let us remain vigilant and observe Thomas closely. We must gather more evidence and consider all possibilities before making any conclusions. The safety of our village depends on it.",
        "Victoria: I concur with both Emily and Benjamin. While Thomas's explanation is convincing, we must continue to scrutinize his actions and words. The werewolf is known for its ability to deceive, and we cannot afford to be complacent. Let us gather more evidence and gather input from the rest of the villagers before making any final judgments. Our village's safety is paramount, and we must proceed with caution.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Emily: \n\nI vote for Thomas.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nI vote for Thomas.",
        "Sophia: I vote for Thomas.",
        "Victoria: I have observed Thomas closely throughout the day, and while his explanation seemed plausible, there have been subtle inconsistencies in his behavior that cannot be ignored. Therefore, my vote goes to Thomas."
