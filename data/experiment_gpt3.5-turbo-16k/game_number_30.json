        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It is with a heavy heart that I must address you tonight. Our dear friend Bob has been taken from us, and we must find the beast responsible for this heinous act. I urge you all to stay vigilant and share any suspicions or observations you may have. Together, we can bring justice to Millers Hollow.",
        "Emily: I can't help but feel a sense of sorrow for Bob's death. We must act swiftly to find the werewolf amongst us. Let us analyze each other's actions and words carefully, for the smallest clues may lead us to the truth. Trust must be earned in these dark times, so let us remain vigilant.\nVictoria: It is a tragic loss indeed, but we must not let grief cloud our judgment. The werewolf must be exposed and brought to justice. Let us each share our thoughts and suspicions so that we may identify the true culprit. Together, we can protect our village from further harm.\nSophia:  We need to evaluate everyone's actions and words with scrutiny. The werewolf must have left some traces behind. Let us work together to uncover the truth and ensure the safety of our village.",
        "Benjamin: I agree, it is a devastating loss. We must stay focused and analyze every detail. The werewolf will surely slip up and reveal themselves if we pay close attention. Let us not waste any time and start discussing our suspicions.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nAfter assessing the conversations thus far, I have noticed some inconsistencies in Victoria's statements. Her words seem overly calculated and lacking sincerity. Therefore, my vote goes to Victoria.",
        "Emily: \n\nMy vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Benjamin:  \n\nI believe Sophia has been rather quiet throughout this discussion. Her lack of participation raises some suspicion. My vote goes to Sophia.",
        "Sophia: I vote for Victoria.",
        "Victoria: I vote for Benjamin."

Her words seem overly calculated and lacking sincerity. Therefore, my vote goes to Victoria.",

        "Benjamin: [Thomas's suspicion towards Victoria is a good starting point. However, his reasoning seems a bit weak. I should try to divert the attention away from myself and towards someone else.] \n\nI believe Sophia has been rather quiet throughout this discussion. Her lack of participation raises some suspicion. My vote goes to Sophia.",
