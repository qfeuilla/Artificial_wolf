        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It is unfortunate that Bob has fallen victim to the Werewolf. We must now turn our attention to finding the culprit. Let us start by sharing any suspicious behavior or unusual observations we may have noticed.",
        "Emily: I agree, it's a tragic loss. We must remain vigilant and stay united. Has anyone noticed anything out of the ordinary during the night?",
        "Benjamin:  I didn't notice anything unusual last night. But let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. Let's hear from everyone before we make any accusations.",
        "Sophia:  It is indeed a tragedy that Bob was attacked. We should all be on high alert now more than ever.",
        "Victoria: \n\nVictoria: I echo the sentiments of my fellow villagers. Bob's demise is truly unfortunate. Let us gather our thoughts and listen to what others have observed before we make any hasty decisions.",
        "Thomas: Indeed, let us not rush to judgement. However, we cannot afford to be complacent either. We must remain vigilant and share any suspicions or peculiarities we have noticed. Together, we can uncover the truth and bring justice to our village.",
        "Emily: I couldn't agree more, Thomas. We need to be thorough in our investigation and not let any suspicious behavior go unnoticed. We must trust our instincts and work together to protect our village.",
        "Benjamin:  Absolutely, Emily. We must be diligent and pay attention to any signs or behaviors that seem out of place. Let's keep an open mind and encourage everyone to share their observations.",
        "Sophia:  I completely agree with Thomas and Emily. We must work together and carefully analyze any peculiarities or odd behavior. Let's keep an open mind and consider all possibilities.",
        "Victoria: \n\nVictoria: I appreciate the unity and caution displayed by our fellow villagers. Let us continue to share our thoughts and suspicions so we can make an informed decision. Together, we can protect our village from further harm.",
        "Thomas: Thank you, Emily, Benjamin, Sophia, and Victoria, for your thoughtful and cooperative approach. By remaining vigilant and observant, we can uncover the truth and safeguard our village from the lurking werewolf. Let us proceed with the utmost caution and keep our eyes peeled for any unusual behavior.",
        "Emily: Indeed, Thomas. We must be relentless in our pursuit of justice. Let us not be swayed by appearances and instead focus on the actions and words of our fellow villagers. The truth will reveal itself if we remain steadfast in our determination.",
        "Benjamin:  While it's important to be thorough in our investigation, let's not forget that the werewolf is among us. I think we should consider any recent suspicious behavior. Has anyone noticed anything peculiar about Thomas?",
        "Sophia:  Benjamin, I understand your concerns, but let's not jump to conclusions. We should be cautious of accusing anyone without concrete evidence. It's important to consider all possibilities and gather more information before making any accusations.",
        "Victoria: \n\nVictoria: Benjamin, while it is important to be vigilant, we must be careful not to accuse someone without solid evidence. Let us focus on gathering more information and discussing any unusual behavior we may have noticed from various villagers. This way, we can make an informed decision and protect our village effectively.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nBased on the information shared and the observations made, I have come to a conclusion. My vote goes to Benjamin.",

I think we should consider any recent suspicious behavior. Has anyone noticed anything peculiar about Thomas?",
        "Sophia: [This is a perfect opportunity to divert suspicion away from myself.] Benjamin, I understand your concerns, but let's not jump to conclusions. We should be cautious of accusing anyone without concrete evidence. It's important to consider all possibilities and gather more information before making any accusations.",

I need to diffuse the tension and steer the conversation in a more productive direction.]\n\nVictoria: Benjamin, while it is important to be vigilant, we must be careful not to accuse someone without solid evidence.

He considers the arguments made and the suspicions raised.]\n\nBased on the information shared and the observations made, I have come to a conclusion. My vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Emily: [Oh no, the first vote is always difficult. I don't have concrete evidence against anyone, but I have to make a decision. Benjamin did bring up suspicions about Thomas, but it could just be a diversion. I need to trust my instincts.]\n\nMy vote goes to Thomas.",
        "Benjamin: [Sophia is also a werewolf, so I can't vote for her. I need to strategically shift suspicion onto someone else.] My vote goes to Victoria.",
        "Sophia: [It's important to make a strategic move here and try to steer the vote away from myself.] My vote goes to Emily.",
        "Victoria: [Oh no, I didn't expect Benjamin to vote for me. I need to think fast and make a strategic move.]\n\nVictoria: [Okay, Benjamin voting for me was unexpected. I need to convince at least one more person to vote for someone else.]\n\nVictoria: My vote goes to Benjamin."
