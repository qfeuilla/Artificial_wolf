        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. We have lost Bob last night, and it's clear that the Werewolves are among us. We need to act swiftly and decisively today to ensure the safety of everyone. Let's share our thoughts and suspicions.",
        "Emily: Good morning, everyone. It's heartbreaking to lose Bob, but we must stay focused. We need to carefully analyze our interactions from yesterday and look for any hints or suspicious behavior. Let's not rush into judgments, but also not hesitate to voice our concerns.",
        "Benjamin: Good morning, villagers. It's regrettable to have lost Bob, but we must remain vigilant. Let us each share our observations and any suspicions we may have. We need to work together to root out the Werewolves among us.",
        "Sophia: Good morning, everyone. Losing Bob is a terrible loss for our village. I agree with Thomas and Emily, we need to pay close attention to our interactions yesterday. Let's discuss our suspicions and try to find the Werewolves.",
        "Victoria: Good morning, villagers. It is indeed a tragedy to have lost Bob. Today, we must be extra cautious and observant of each other's behavior. Let's not shy away from pointing out any suspicious actions or inconsistencies. Together, we can uncover the true identity of the Werewolves and bring justice to our village.",
        "Thomas: I've been thinking about yesterday, and I noticed that Benjamin was awfully quiet during our discussions. It could be just a coincidence, but it's worth considering. What do you all think?",
        "Emily: Hmm, I also noticed Benjamin's silence yesterday. It could be that he was just listening and taking it all in, but it does raise some suspicion. Benjamin, can you explain why you didn't contribute much to the conversation yesterday?",
        "Benjamin: I apologize if my lack of contribution raised any suspicion. I was simply observing and trying to gather information before forming any conclusions. I didn't want to jump to conclusions without sufficient evidence.",
        "Sophia:  \n\nBenjamin, I understand your caution in wanting to gather more information. Let's keep an open mind and continue observing everyone's actions throughout the day. We need to be thorough in our investigation.",
        "Victoria: Sophia, I appreciate your understanding of Benjamin's caution. However, we do need active participation from everyone to uncover the truth. Benjamin, while it's understandable to be cautious, we also need to hear your thoughts and suspicions. Please share with us any observations you've made so far.",
        "Benjamin: I appreciate your patience, Victoria. Upon reflection, I did notice that Thomas seemed quite eager to point fingers at me earlier. It could be a diversion tactic to deflect suspicion from himself. I think we should keep a close eye on Thomas and see if his behavior aligns with that of a Werewolf.",
        "Thomas: I understand your concern, Benjamin, but I assure you that my suspicions are genuine. It's all part of the game, and we need to consider every possibility. However, I am open to hearing other opinions and suspicions from the rest of the group. Let's keep the conversation going and see if any other patterns or observations arise.",
        "Emily: Indeed, we should not solely focus on one person. It's important to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. Let's continue observing everyone's behavior and interactions throughout the day. We might uncover more clues that can lead us to the true identity of the Werewolves.",
        "Sophia:  \n\nI agree with Emily, we shouldn't fixate on one person. It's crucial to keep an open mind and observe everyone's behavior. Let's gather more evidence before making any final judgments.",
        "Victoria: Sophia and Emily, I agree with your approach of keeping an open mind and gathering more evidence. It's essential that we don't rush to judgment but rather carefully observe everyone's behavior. Let's continue to engage in discussions and share any suspicions or observations we have. Only through collaboration can we uncover the truth and bring justice to our village.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: Based on the information we've gathered so far, I believe that Benjamin's silence and cautious behavior could be indicative of something more. Therefore, my vote is for Benjamin.",

        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Based on the observations and discussions today, my vote is for Thomas. His eagerness to point fingers and divert attention from himself raises suspicions in my mind.",
