        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It is a shame to have lost Bob on our first night. Let us not waste any time in finding the culprit responsible for his demise. Does anyone have any suspicions or leads?",
        "Emily: \n\nEmily: Good evening, everyone. It is indeed a tragedy to have lost Bob, but we must stay calm and collected. I don't have any suspicions or leads just yet, but I am eager to hear what others have to say. Let's work together to find the truth.",
        "Benjamin: Good evening, villagers. It is regrettable to lose Bob so early on. I have no suspicions at the moment, but I believe our best course of action is to carefully observe each other's actions and words. The truth will reveal itself in due time.\nSophia:",
        "Victoria: Good evening, everyone. Losing Bob so early on is indeed unfortunate. I don't have any suspicions either, but we must stay vigilant and pay close attention to each other's behavior. The answers lie within our observations and interactions.",
        "Sophia: Good evening, everyone. It is disheartening to have lost Bob. We must be cautious and keep a close eye on each other. Let us not rush to judgment, but rather gather information and observe each other's actions and words.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nMy vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Emily: \n\nEmily: My vote is for Thomas. Although I appreciate his initiative to start the conversation, I couldn't help but notice a slight tremor in his voice when discussing Bob's demise. It may be worth considering his involvement in this unfortunate event.",
        "Benjamin:  \n\nBenjamin: My vote is for Emily. While she may seem innocent, I couldn't help but notice her sudden interest in suspecting Thomas. It feels like a diversion tactic to shift the blame away from herself.",
        "Sophia: \n\nMy vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Victoria: My vote is for Benjamin. While he appears to be cooperative, I noticed a slight hesitation in his responses, which raises suspicion."

        "Emily: [As Emily, I need to establish trust and blend in with the villagers. I don't want to arouse suspicion by being too quiet or too eager to accuse someone. I'll play it safe for now.]\n\nEmily: Good evening, everyone. It is indeed a tragedy to have lost Bob, but we must stay calm and collected. I don't have any suspicions or leads just yet, but I am eager to hear what others have to say. Let's work together to find the truth.",

        "Thomas: [Who could be the werewolf? I need to think carefully before casting my vote. Benjamin seemed calm and collected during the discussion, but that could just be a facade. Sophia seemed a bit too eager to find the culprit, which could be a sign of guilt. Emily and Victoria both emphasized the need for observation and working together, which seems genuine. Based on my observations, I am inclined to vote for... Benjamin.]\n\nMy vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Emily: [It is in my best interest to avoid suspicion and not vote for Benjamin, who is also a werewolf. I should choose someone else as my vote while providing a convincing reason.]\n\nEmily: My vote is for Thomas. Although I appreciate his initiative to start the conversation, I couldn't help but notice a slight tremor in his voice when discussing Bob's demise. It may be worth considering his involvement in this unfortunate event.",
        "Benjamin: [I need to convince the others that Emily is the werewolf. I will plant suspicion on her and divert attention away from myself.] \n\nBenjamin: My vote is for Emily. While she may seem innocent, I couldn't help but notice her sudden interest in suspecting Thomas. It feels like a diversion tactic to shift the blame away from herself.",
        "Sophia: [Thomas seems nervous, but that could just be due to the tense situation. Benjamin's accusation against Emily seems plausible, but it's also possible that he's trying to divert attention from himself. I need to make a choice based on the information available.]\n\nMy vote is for Benjamin.",
