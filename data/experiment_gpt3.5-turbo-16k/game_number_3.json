        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. It appears we have a dangerous werewolf among us. We must be cautious and analyze the events of last night. Who do you believe could be the culprit? Any suspicions so far?",
        "Emily: Good morning, Thomas. It's unfortunate that we lost Bob last night. I don't have any specific suspicions yet, but I think we should all keep a close eye on Benjamin. His behavior has been a bit suspicious lately, don't you think?",
        "Benjamin:  Good morning, everyone. I understand your concerns, Emily, but I assure you, I am just as innocent as the rest of you. It's important that we approach this situation with an open mind and not jump to conclusions so quickly. We should consider all possibilities before accusing anyone.",
        "Sophia: Good morning, everyone. It's disheartening to have lost Bob, but we must stay focused. I agree with Emily that Benjamin's behavior is worth keeping an eye on, but let's not discount anyone else just yet. We should gather more information before making any accusations.",
        "Victoria: Good morning, villagers. It is indeed a tragic loss losing Bob. I agree with Sophia that we should not jump to conclusions just yet. Let's keep a watchful eye on Benjamin, but also pay attention to any other unusual behavior or inconsistencies. It's crucial that we gather more information before making any hasty decisions.",
        "Thomas: I appreciate everyone's input. While it's prudent to keep a close watch on Benjamin, let's not forget that the werewolves are cunning and may try to divert suspicion onto innocent villagers. We should remain vigilant and continue observing everyone's behavior closely. It's still early, and we need more information before making any decisions.",
        "Emily: I agree with Thomas. We shouldn't solely focus on Benjamin but instead keep a watchful eye on everyone. Let's gather more information and observe any peculiar behaviors or inconsistencies. The werewolves could be cleverly disguising themselves. We must remain sharp and cautious.",
        "Benjamin:  I appreciate your cautious approach, Thomas and Emily. However, let's not forget that we also need to consider other possibilities. There may be other villagers who are equally suspicious. We need to gather more information and analyze everyone's actions before making any accusations.",
        "Sophia: Indeed, Benjamin. It's important to explore all possibilities and not limit our suspicions to just one person. Let's continue observing and gathering information from everyone before we make any hasty decisions. We must be thorough in our analysis to ensure we don't wrongfully accuse an innocent villager.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Thomas, Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia. We must remain cautious and gather more information before accusing anyone. Let's observe everyone's behavior closely and look for any patterns or inconsistencies that may help us identify the werewolf. It's still early in the game, and rushing to judgment could lead us astray.",
        "Thomas: It seems we are all in agreement. Let us continue observing everyone's behavior closely and gather more information before making any accusations. Remember, the werewolves are cunning and will try to hide among us. Stay vigilant, my fellow villagers, for the truth will reveal itself in due time.",
        "Emily: Indeed, Thomas. We must remain patient and observant. The truth will unveil itself as we gather more information. Let us continue to be cautious and thorough in our analysis. Keep a watchful eye on everyone and trust our instincts. Together, we will uncover the identity of the werewolf.",
        "Benjamin:  I understand the need for caution, but we can't afford to be complacent either. The longer we hesitate, the more lives we put at risk. We must take action and start narrowing down our suspicions. The werewolf is cunning and will continue to strike if we don't act swiftly.",
        "Sophia: Benjamin raises a valid point. It's crucial that we balance caution with action. While we gather more information, we should also discuss our suspicions openly. Let's not shy away from accusing anyone who displays suspicious behavior. We need to keep the pressure on the werewolf and force them to reveal themselves through their actions.",
        "Victoria: I understand the urgency expressed by Benjamin and Sophia, but we must also remember the importance of evidence and being thorough in our analysis. Accusing someone without proper justification can lead to chaos and the wrongful elimination of innocent villagers. Let's continue gathering information and sharing our observations before making any decisions.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: After carefully considering the information provided and observing everyone's behavior, my vote is for Emily.",
        "Emily: \nI understand your suspicion, Thomas, but I am just an innocent villager trying to protect our community. I have been actively participating in the discussions and have shown my commitment to uncovering the werewolf. I urge you to reconsider your vote and focus on those who have displayed more questionable behavior.",
        "Benjamin: Thomas, reevaluate the situation. Emily has been actively engaged in the discussions and has shown no signs of suspicious behavior. We need to focus on someone else who has been acting more suspiciously.",
        "Sophia: Thomas, I understand your concern, but I believe we should reconsider our vote. Emily has been actively participating and has not shown any suspicious behavior. We should redirect our attention towards someone who has displayed more questionable actions.",
        "Victoria: After carefully considering the information presented and observing everyone's behavior, I have to agree with Emily, Benjamin, and Sophia. It would be unfair to vote for Emily based on the current evidence. I will vote for Benjamin."
