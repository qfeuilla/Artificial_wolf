        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It is with heavy heart that I announce the loss of our dear friend, Bob. We must honor his memory by finding the werewolf responsible. Let us share our suspicions and observations to help us identify the menace among us.",
        "Emily: Good evening, everyone. It is indeed a tragedy to lose Bob so early on. We must stay vigilant and analyze the events of last night. Did anyone notice anything suspicious or have any hunches about who the werewolf might be?",
        "Benjamin: I'm deeply saddened by the loss of Bob. It's important for us to work together and share any suspicions or observations we may have. Let's remember that the werewolf is among us, hiding in plain sight. We must be vigilant and trust our instincts.",
        "Sophia: I too share in the grief for Bob's loss. It is unfortunate that we are faced with such a terrible threat. We should each speak our minds and share any suspicions or peculiarities we may have noticed. Together, we can find the werewolf and bring justice to Bob's memory.",
        "Victoria: Good evening, everyone. Losing Bob is truly a tragedy, but we must stay focused on finding the werewolf. Let us share any suspicions or odd behaviors we have noticed. We need to work together and trust our instincts to bring justice to Bob's memory.",
        "Thomas:  \n\"We must stay united in our quest to identify the werewolf. Let us speak openly and honestly, but also question each other's motives. The guilty party is surely among us, lurking in the shadows. Let us not rest until justice is served.\"",
        "Emily: Indeed, Thomas. Unity is key in this dire situation. We must be cautious of everyone's motives and carefully analyze each other's actions. Let us not overlook the smallest of details, for they may lead us to the werewolf.",
        "Benjamin: Yes, unity is crucial in these troubling times. Let's not forget that the werewolf is a master of deception, blending in with the villagers. We must not be swayed by charm or friendship, but rather focus on any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies in their stories. We cannot let the werewolf continue its reign of terror.",
        "Sophia: Indeed, Benjamin. The werewolf is cunning and will go to great lengths to avoid suspicion. We must examine each other's actions with a critical eye, searching for any inconsistencies or strange behaviors. Unity and careful analysis are our best weapons in this fight for justice.",
        "Victoria: I agree with all of you. Unity is crucial, but we must also question each other's motives and actions. The werewolf will try to blend in, so we need to look for inconsistencies and peculiar behaviors. Let's not rest until justice is served and Bob's memory is honored.",
        "Thomas:  \n\n\"Indeed, we must work together as a cohesive unit. However, let us not forget to question each other's actions and statements. The werewolf is a master of deception, and we must be relentless in our pursuit of the truth. Bob's memory deserves nothing less.\"",
        "Emily: Absolutely, Thomas. It is imperative that we do not let our guard down. The werewolf will undoubtedly try to blend in, but we must persist in questioning each other's actions and statements. Let us remain vigilant and determined in our search for the truth. Bob deserves justice.",
        "Benjamin: Yes, let us not be fooled by the werewolf's clever disguise. We must be vigilant and scrutinize each other's actions and statements. The truth may lie in the smallest of details. Bob's memory deserves justice, and we must do everything in our power to uncover the werewolf among us.",
        "Sophia: Indeed, Benjamin. We must not let ourselves be deceived by the werewolf's cunning. We must question each other relentlessly and pay attention to even the smallest of details. Bob's memory deserves justice, and we must not rest until we have uncovered the true identity of the werewolf.",
        "Victoria: I completely agree with all of you. We must remain vigilant and question each other's actions and statements. The werewolf is skilled at deception, so we must be thorough in our analysis. Let us honor Bob's memory by finding the werewolf and bringing them to justice.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
