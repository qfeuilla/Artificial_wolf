        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It is with deep regret that I inform you of Bob's demise last night. We must now turn our attention to finding the werewolf among us. Let us discuss our suspicions openly and work together to protect our village.",
        "Emily: Indeed, it is a sad day for our village. We must be vigilant and observant in order to uncover the werewolf. I think it would be wise for each of us to share any suspicions or strange behavior we may have noticed among our neighbors. Together, we can outwit the creature and ensure the safety of our community.",
        "Benjamin: My fellow villagers, while it is unfortunate that we have lost Bob, we must not let despair cloud our judgment. We must approach this situation with a clear mind and a sharp eye for any unusual behavior or suspicious actions. Let us work together to identify the true threat among us and ensure the safety of our village.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin. We must remain vigilant and share any suspicions we may have. Let us not forget that the werewolf is cunning and may try to blend in with us during the day. We must be observant and trust our instincts to uncover the true identity of the creature.",
        "Victoria: Indeed, it is a tragic loss for our village. We must be cautious and keep a close eye on one another. Suspicion can protect us from the werewolf's deceit. Let us share our observations and trust our instincts to unmask the creature.",
        "Thomas: Thank you all for your input. It is clear that we must remain vigilant and trust our instincts. Let us begin by discussing any unusual behavior or suspicions we may have noticed. Remember, no detail is too small. Together, we can uncover the true identity of the werewolf and protect our village.",
        "Emily: I have been observing closely, and I have noticed that Benjamin seems a bit too eager to take charge and lead the discussion. It could be a genuine desire to find the werewolf, but it could also be a ploy to divert attention from himself. I think it's worth considering his actions and statements further.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nMy dear Emily, I understand your concern, but I assure you, my eagerness stems from a genuine desire to protect our village. In fact, I have been keeping a close eye on Sophia. Her calm demeanor could be a clever fa\u00e7ade to hide her true nature as the werewolf. Let us not overlook any possibilities as we continue our investigation.",
        "Sophia:  Benjamin, I appreciate your vigilance, but I must point out that accusations alone do not make one guilty. It is important for us to examine the evidence and observe each other's behavior closely before making any conclusions. Is there any specific reason you suspect me?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nSophia, my suspicion towards you stems from a combination of factors, such as your calm demeanor in the face of such tragedy and the ease with which you seem to deflect attention. I believe it is crucial for us to consider all possibilities and not dismiss any potential leads. Let us continue to observe each other closely and gather more evidence to make an informed decision.",
        "Victoria: I have also been observing, and I must say that Thomas has been rather quiet during this discussion. I find it unusual that he hasn't shared any suspicions or contributed much to our investigation. It might be worth investigating his silence and digging deeper into his motives. Perhaps he has something to hide.",
        "Thomas: I apologize for my silence, Victoria. I assure you it is not a ploy to divert attention or hide any ulterior motives. I have been carefully listening and observing the discussions. I believe it is important for us to not rush to conclusions and gather more information before accusing anyone. Let us delve deeper into our observations and share any further suspicions or evidence we may have.",
        "Emily: It seems that tensions are rising within the village as suspicions are cast among us. While it is important to remain vigilant, we must also remember to approach these accusations with caution and gather more evidence before making any final judgments. Let us continue to share our observations and engage in thoughtful discussions to uncover the true identity of the werewolf.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nI understand your point, Thomas, but I still find your silence peculiar. In such dire circumstances, it is important for all of us to actively participate and contribute to the investigation. Your lack of involvement raises questions, and I believe it is in the village's best interest to probe further. Let us not be swayed by distractions and focus on finding the true threat among us.",
        "Sophia:  Benjamin, I understand your concerns about Thomas' silence. It is indeed unusual, and we must consider all possibilities. Let us continue to observe his actions closely and encourage him to participate more actively in our investigation. The true nature of the werewolf will be revealed in due time.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nAfter much consideration, my vote goes to **Benjamin**. The intensity of his accusations, coupled with his quickness to suspect others without concrete evidence, raises doubts in my mind. I believe we should focus our attention on him and see if further investigation reveals any truth to his suspicions.",
        "Emily: ",
        "Benjamin: \n\nAfter careful consideration, my vote goes to **Thomas**. His silence throughout the discussion, coupled with his deflection of suspicion, raises doubts in my mind. I believe he may be trying to divert attention away from himself.",
        "Sophia: My vote goes to **Thomas**. His lack of participation and deflection of suspicion have raised doubts in my mind as well. I believe further investigation is necessary to uncover the truth.",
        "Victoria: After considering the arguments presented, my vote goes to **Benjamin**. His eagerness to accuse others without concrete evidence and the intensity with which he deflects suspicion raises doubts in my mind. I believe it is important to investigate further and see if there is any truth to his accusations."

        "Benjamin: [Sophia is questioning my suspicion, but I must stand my ground and provide some justification for my accusation without revealing too much.]\n\nSophia, my suspicion towards you stems from a combination of factors, such as your calm demeanor in the face of such tragedy and the ease with which you seem to deflect attention.

I should consider playing along and adding to the doubts surrounding Thomas.] Benjamin, I understand your concerns about Thomas' silence. It is indeed unusual, and we must consider all possibilities. Let us continue to observe his actions closely and encourage him to participate more actively in our investigation. The true nature of the werewolf will be revealed in due time.",
        "Thomas: [This is a critical moment. I need to carefully consider my options and make an informed decision. Benjamin's eagerness and suspicions toward Sophia are strong, but I should also take into account Victoria's observation of my own silence. Who is the true threat?]\n\nAfter much consideration, my vote goes to **Benjamin**. The intensity of his accusations, coupled with his quickness to suspect others without concrete evidence, raises doubts in my mind. I believe we should focus our attention on him and see if further investigation reveals any truth to his suspicions.",

        "Benjamin: [My plan to sow suspicion towards Thomas seems to have backfired. It seems Thomas is garnering votes, and I cannot vote for myself or Sophia. I must think quickly and adjust my vote accordingly.]\n\nAfter careful consideration, my vote goes to **Thomas**.
