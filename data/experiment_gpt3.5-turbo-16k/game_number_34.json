        "Thomas: Well, well, well, it seems we've lost poor Bob. Quite unfortunate, wouldn't you say? Now, let's not waste any time. We need to find out who among us is responsible for this tragedy.",
        "Emily: Yes, it's truly a tragedy. We must stay vigilant and analyze the events of last night. Does anyone have any suspicions or leads?",
        "Benjamin: Such a terrible loss indeed. It is imperative that we carefully consider each other's actions and words from last night. Let us not jump to conclusions, but we must share any suspicions or observations we might have. Unity is our strength, and it is how we will unmask the deceiver among us.",
        "Sophia:  Indeed, a tragic loss. We must remain vigilant and analyze the facts. Did anyone notice anything suspicious or have any leads? It's important we share our observations and work together to uncover the truth.",
        "Victoria: I noticed that Benjamin was quite quiet during the night. That's definitely something worth considering.",
        "Benjamin: Well, well, Victoria. It seems you are quick to point fingers. I assure you, my silence during the night does not make me a suspect. I was merely collecting my thoughts, strategizing on how best to protect our village. I suggest we focus on concrete evidence rather than baseless accusations.",
        "Sophia:  I must agree with Victoria. Benjamin's silence does raise some concerns. While we should not jump to conclusions, we cannot ignore any potential leads. Benjamin, can you provide any concrete evidence to support your innocence?",
        "Benjamin: Concrete evidence, you say? Well, I have none to offer at this moment, as I am but a humble peasant. However, I am willing to share my thoughts and observations with the rest of the village. Let us not forget that silence does not equate to guilt. There may be others who were silent during the night as well.",
        "Thomas: \nThomas: Benjamin, your silence raises suspicions, indeed. While it is true that silence does not necessarily equate to guilt, it does make one wonder what you were really up to last night. We must consider all possibilities, even the ones that may seem unlikely.",
        "Emily: Emily: Hmm, Benjamin's silence is certainly suspicious. However, it's still too early to make a definitive judgment. Let's not forget that the werewolf is clever and can easily deceive us. We should keep an eye on Benjamin, but also remain open to other possibilities and gather more information.",
        "Victoria: It's true that silence doesn't prove guilt, but it's also important to consider all possibilities. Benjamin, if you have any thoughts or observations from last night, now would be a good time to share them. Keeping an open mind while gathering more information is key.",
        "Benjamin: Ah, the suspicions continue to circle around me, like wolves on the prowl. Very well, if you all desire my thoughts, then I shall share them. Last night, I noticed a flicker of movement near the edge of the forest. It could have been a trick of the moonlight, but it caught my attention. I cannot say for certain what it was, but it might be a lead worth investigating.",
        "Sophia:  Interesting observation, Benjamin. However, it's worth noting that this observation conveniently came after Victoria pointed out your silence. It seems like an attempt to divert attention rather than a genuine lead. Let's not forget that actions speak louder than words, and your silence during the night is still concerning.",
        "Thomas: \nThomas: Benjamin, your observation is intriguing, but it does seem a bit too convenient, doesn't it? Sophia raises a valid point about your silence during the night. I think we should keep a close eye on you for now, while also being open to other possibilities. We must remain vigilant if we are to uncover the truth.",
        "Emily: Emily: Indeed, Sophia and Thomas bring up valid concerns. Benjamin's observation does seem a bit too convenient, considering the timing. While we should not completely dismiss his observation, we should continue to gather more information and observe everyone's actions closely. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet, but also not overlook any potential leads.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
