        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It's truly unfortunate that we've already lost Bob to the claws of the Werewolf. We must tread carefully and be vigilant in our search for the true identity of this menace. Any ideas on who we should suspect?",
        "Emily: Good evening, everyone. It's a tragic loss indeed. I think we should start by analyzing Bob's behavior and interactions from yesterday. Did anyone notice anything suspicious or out of the ordinary?",
        "Benjamin:  I agree with Emily, we should definitely look into Bob's behavior. Although, I did notice Victoria acting quite nervous during the discussion yesterday. Perhaps we should investigate her further.",
        "Sophia: \n\nI also noticed Victoria's nervousness yesterday. It could be an indication of her involvement with the Werewolf. We should definitely keep an eye on her.",
        "Victoria:  \nIt's understandable that you would be suspicious of me, given the tragic loss of Bob. However, I assure you that my nervousness stems from the shock of losing a fellow villager. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should consider other possibilities as well.",
        "Thomas: I understand your concern, Victoria, but it's crucial for us to consider all possibilities. We can't afford to dismiss anyone at this point. Let's keep a close eye on everyone and gather more information before drawing any final conclusions.",
        "Emily: Yes, I agree with Thomas. While it's natural to feel uneasy in these circumstances, let's not rush to judgment. We should observe everyone's behavior closely and gather more evidence before making any decisions. It's important for us to remain vigilant and work together to uncover the true identity of the Werewolf.",
        "Benjamin:  While I understand the need for caution, we can't ignore the fact that Victoria's nervousness does raise suspicion. I think it's worth investigating further before we move on to other possibilities.",
        "Sophia: \n\nI agree with Benjamin. Victoria's behavior did seem suspicious to me as well. It would be wise for us to investigate further and gather more evidence before making any hasty decisions.",
        "Victoria:  \nI understand your concerns, but let's not forget that suspicion alone is not enough to accuse someone. It's easy to misinterpret nervousness as guilt. I would suggest that we look at other factors and behavior patterns as well. Accusing someone solely based on nerves could lead us down the wrong path. Let's consider all possibilities and gather more evidence before making any accusations.",
        "Thomas: I agree with Victoria. While it's important to consider all possibilities, we should not solely rely on one factor to accuse someone. Let's continue to observe everyone's behavior closely and gather more evidence before drawing any conclusions. It's crucial that we approach this with a fair and open mind.",
        "Emily: I understand the concerns raised about Victoria's behavior, but I agree with Thomas and Victoria. We shouldn't jump to conclusions based solely on nervousness. Let's continue to observe and gather more evidence from everyone before making any accusations. We need to be fair and thorough in our investigation.",
        "Benjamin:  While I understand the importance of being fair and thorough, we must also consider the fact that the Werewolf would naturally try to deflect suspicion. Victoria's attempts to downplay her nervousness could be seen as a way to divert attention. Let's not discount the possibility that she may be involved.",
        "Sophia: \n\nWhile it's true that we shouldn't solely rely on nervousness as evidence, we should also be aware that the Werewolf would try to manipulate the situation to their advantage. We can't ignore the fact that Victoria's behavior is raising suspicions among multiple villagers. I believe it's worth investigating further to ensure the safety of our village.",
        "Victoria:  \nI understand your concerns, but let's not lose sight of the fact that accusing someone solely based on suspicion can lead us astray. If we're going to investigate based on behavior, I would also urge you to pay attention to Benjamin's behavior. His quickness to accuse me could be seen as an attempt to divert attention from himself. Let's consider all possibilities and gather more evidence before making any hasty accusations.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

Benjamin, could you please explain your reasoning behind your vote for Sophia? It seems like a sudden shift in focus, and I think it's essential for us to understand your perspective before we finalize our votes."

Although, I did notice Victoria acting quite nervous during the discussion yesterday. Perhaps we should investigate her further.",
        "Sophia: [Hmm, Victoria seems to be casting suspicion on someone else. It might be a good opportunity to divert attention and make myself seem innocent. I'll support Benjamin's suggestion.]\n\nI also noticed Victoria's nervousness yesterday. It could be an indication of her involvement with the Werewolf. We should definitely keep an eye on her.",

Victoria's attempts to downplay her nervousness could be seen as a way to divert attention. Let's not discount the possibility that she may be involved.",

        "Thomas: [This is a tough decision. Both Victoria and Benjamin raise valid points, and it's difficult to discern who may be the werewolf. However, I can't ignore the fact that multiple villagers find Victoria's behavior suspicious. I need to trust my instincts on this one.]\n\nMy vote is for Victoria.",
        "Emily: [It's a tough decision, but Benjamin's quickness to accuse Victoria does raise some suspicions. On the other hand, Victoria's attempt to divert attention towards Benjamin also seems manipulative. I need to make a careful and calculated decision here.]\n\nMy vote is for Victoria.",

I need to convince him to change his vote to avoid elimination.]\n\n[Benjamin's suspicion of Sophia seems unwarranted, and if he sticks to his vote, it'll be a tie between Sophia and me. I can use that to my advantage.]\n\nI understand the concerns raised about me, but I would like to question Benjamin's suspicion of Sophia.
