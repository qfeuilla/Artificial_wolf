        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that poor Bob has met an unfortunate fate at the hands (or should I say paws?) of the Werewolf. We must act swiftly and decisively to ensure our survival. Let us start by sharing any suspicions or observations we may have.",
        "Emily: \nThomas, I share your sadness at Bob's demise. We must be vigilant and work together to uncover the true identity of the Werewolf. I suggest we start by discussing any strange behavior or suspicious actions that anyone may have noticed.",
        "Benjamin: Thank you for your concern, Thomas and Emily. It is indeed a tragic loss for our village. In light of recent events, we must be cautious, as the Werewolf could be anyone among us. I propose that we each share our thoughts on who we believe may be the culprit.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin, we must be cautious and consider all possibilities. It is crucial that we share our suspicions and observations with one another to uncover the truth. Let us not jump to conclusions, but carefully analyze each other's behavior and statements.",
        "Victoria:  \n\nIndeed, it is a tragic loss for our village. I have been observing everyone closely, and I must say, Thomas, your sudden concern for Bob's demise is quite intriguing. It's almost as if you are trying to divert attention away from yourself. Perhaps we should start by discussing your whereabouts during the night?",
        "Thomas: \n\nVictoria, I assure you that my concern for Bob's demise is genuine. I understand your need for caution, but I believe it is important to focus on finding the true Werewolf rather than accusing each other without evidence. As for my whereabouts during the night, I was in my cottage, sound asleep. I invite anyone to confirm this. Let us proceed with logic and reason, not baseless accusations.",
        "Emily: \n\nVictoria, I understand your desire for answers, but let's not single out individuals without concrete evidence. We should consider all possibilities and not rush to judgment. Sophia, what are your thoughts on the matter? Do you have any suspicions or observations you'd like to share?",
        "Sophia: I believe it is too early to make any definitive accusations. Each of us should be given the opportunity to present our alibis and observations. Let us approach this with an open mind and consider all possibilities. In the meantime, I have not noticed anything particularly suspicious, but I will continue to observe closely.",
        "Benjamin: Indeed, Sophia, it would be premature to make any hasty accusations. We must exercise caution and gather more information before jumping to conclusions. As for myself, I have been observing each of you carefully, and while I cannot say for certain who the Werewolf is at this moment, I am committed to uncovering the truth. Let us continue to share our thoughts and suspicions as we work towards a resolution.",
        "Victoria: \n\nI appreciate the cautious approach, but we must also be proactive in our search for the Werewolf. Thomas, while I understand you were in your cottage, can anyone else vouch for your alibi? It would be unfortunate if our trust was misplaced. Let us all remain vigilant and continue to share any peculiar behavior we observe.",
        "Thomas: \n\nVictoria, I appreciate your desire for clarity. While I understand that it is vital to verify alibis, I believe it is equally important to remain open-minded. As for my alibi, I have no doubt that my fellow villagers can vouch for my presence in my cottage. I trust that they will speak up if they have any reason to doubt my whereabouts. Let us remember to approach this game with reason and not let baseless accusations cloud our judgment.",
        "Emily: \n\nI agree with Sophia and Benjamin. It is important to approach this game with caution and gather more information before making any accusations. Let us not forget that the Werewolf is cunning and could be hiding among us, waiting for the right moment to strike. We must be thorough in our observations and discussions, and most importantly, we must remain united.",
        "Sophia: I echo Emily's sentiment. Unity is key in times like these. Let us continue to observe, discuss, and share any unusual behavior or suspicions without jumping to conclusions. By working together and keeping an open mind, we will increase our chances of uncovering the true identity of the Werewolf.",
        "Benjamin: I completely agree with Emily and Sophia. Unity and open-mindedness are essential in this game. We must remain diligent in our observations and discussions, but let us not let paranoia drive a wedge between us. It is still early in the game, and we have much ground to cover. Remember, the Werewolf is among us, lurking in the shadows, waiting for the opportune moment to strike again. We must remain vigilant and support one another as we navigate this treacherous terrain.",
        "Victoria: \n\nWhile unity is important, we must also remember that skepticism is necessary in a game like this. Let us not dismiss any suspicions or observations lightly. I urge you all to remain vigilant and share any further doubts or insights that may arise. The Werewolf thrives in deception, and we must be relentless in our pursuit of the truth.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\n\n\nMy vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Emily: \n\nThomas, I understand your suspicion towards Benjamin, but let us not forget that we must have solid evidence before making such accusations. While Benjamin has been observant and engaged in the discussion, his actions and statements have been consistent with those of a concerned villager. Let us not jump to conclusions without concrete evidence.",
        "Benjamin: Thomas, I must respectfully disagree with your vote. Benjamin has been actively participating in the discussion and has shown genuine concern for the well-being of our village. Accusing him without substantial evidence would be unfair and counterproductive. Let us remember to approach this game with reason and not let paranoia cloud our judgment.",
        "Sophia: After careful consideration, my vote goes to Victoria. Her persistent focus on skepticism and her attempts to divert attention from herself raise suspicion. While it is important to question and be vigilant, her actions feel more calculated than genuine concern for the village's well-being.",
        "Victoria: \n\nI understand the concern, Sophia, but let us not forget that Benjamin has been quite vocal in his defense. It makes me wonder if he is trying to deflect attention away from himself. His consistent engagement in the discussion could also be a guise to appear innocent. We must be cautious and consider all possibilities."
