        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It saddens me to hear about Bob's demise. Let us not waste time in avenging him. We must act swiftly to root out the wickedness among us. Who has any suspicions or information to share?",
        "Emily: I agree with Thomas, we cannot afford to waste any time. We need to find the werewolf among us. Does anyone have any leads or suspicions based on last night's events?",
        "Benjamin:  I believe we should consider who had the most to gain from Bob's death. Who among us had a personal grudge against Bob or stood to benefit from his demise?",
        "Sophia:  \n\nI'm deeply saddened by Bob's death. We must stay vigilant and work together to find the werewolf. It could be anyone among us, and we can't afford to let the true culprit escape justice. Let's carefully observe everyone's behavior and actions, and share any suspicions we may have.",
        "Victoria: Yes, I agree. It's crucial that we analyze everyone's behavior and actions from last night. Let's not rush to judgment, but let's also not ignore any potential signs or suspicions. We must be thorough in our investigation to ensure we don't let the werewolf slip through our fingers.",
        "Thomas: Indeed, vigilance is key in our quest to identify the werewolf. Pay close attention to everyone's actions and words. Let us share our suspicions openly and discuss any peculiar behavior we may have noticed. We must work together to protect our village from further harm.",
        "Emily: Yes, vigilance and observation are crucial. Let's not be hasty in our judgments, but also not be afraid to voice our suspicions. We need to analyze the actions and behavior of each villager carefully. Remember, the werewolf could be anyone among us. Let's stay focused and determined in our search for the truth.",
        "Benjamin:  Has anyone noticed any peculiar behavior or inconsistencies in someone's actions last night? Any gut feelings or instincts pointing towards a particular villager?",
        "Sophia: \n\nI haven't noticed anything particularly suspicious last night, but I'll definitely keep a keen eye on everyone's actions moving forward. Let's stay vigilant and gather more information before making any hasty accusations. We need to be thorough in our investigation.",
        "Victoria: Yes, Sophia, you're right. We shouldn't jump to conclusions without concrete evidence. Let's observe everyone closely and gather more information before accusing anyone. We must be patient and thorough in our investigation to ensure we don't make any mistakes. The werewolf is cunning, but we can outsmart them with careful observation and analysis.",
        "Thomas: I appreciate your caution, Sophia and Victoria. It is wise to gather more information and observe everyone closely before making any accusations. We must be thorough and patient in our investigation. Let us continue to share our observations and suspicions, but also keep an open mind and be willing to reassess as new information arises. The truth will reveal itself if we stay focused and diligent.",
        "Emily: I completely agree with Sophia, Victoria, and Thomas. We must exercise caution and patience in our investigation. Let's continue to observe everyone closely and gather more information before making any accusations. The werewolf is clever, but with our collective vigilance and determination, we can uncover their true identity. Let's stay focused and keep our minds open to all possibilities.",
        "Benjamin:  While we gather more information, has anyone noticed any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in someone's story? Perhaps someone acting overly defensive or deflecting attention away from themselves? Let's delve deeper into our observations to uncover the truth.",
        "Sophia: \n\nI haven't noticed anything unusual or inconsistent so far, but I'm definitely keeping a watchful eye. Benjamin, since you brought it up, have you noticed anything specific that caught your attention? It would be helpful to hear your insights.",
        "Benjamin:  I'm just as keen as everyone else to find the werewolf. Let's continue to observe closely and share any suspicious behavior we come across. Remember, the werewolf is cunning and may try to blend in, so we must be diligent in our search.",

You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
