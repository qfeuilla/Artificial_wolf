        "Thomas: Well, well, well, what a night it has been. It seems we have lost poor Bob to the clutches of the Werewolf. We must be on high alert and not fall victim to their cunning ways. Let us discuss and determine who among us might be the harbinger of this evil. Any thoughts?",
        "Emily:  It's a shame to lose Bob so early in the game. We need to stay vigilant and look for any signs of unusual behavior or suspicious activity. Did anyone notice anything out of the ordinary last night?",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Yes, it's truly unfortunate to lose Bob so early. We should definitely keep an eye out for any strange or suspicious behavior. Did anyone notice anything unusual last night? Any thoughts on who the Werewolf might be?",
        "Sophia: ",
        "Victoria: \n\nVictoria: It's a tragedy to lose Bob so early. We must be vigilant and scrutinize each other for any signs of deceit or unusual behavior. Let's share our observations from last night and any suspicions we may have.",
        "Sophia: I understand your concerns, Victoria. Losing Bob so early is indeed unfortunate. As for last night, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. It's crucial that we pay attention to each other's behavior and search for any inconsistencies.",
        "Thomas: Well, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. It's important to keep an open mind and consider all possibilities. We shouldn't let our emotions cloud our judgment. Instead, let's focus on gathering more information and observing each other's actions closely. Remember, looks can be deceiving, and the Werewolf is skilled at hiding in plain sight.",
        "Emily:  I agree with Thomas. It's important to keep an open mind and gather more information before making any accusations. Let's continue observing each other's actions and look for any suspicious behavior. We need solid evidence before we can determine who the werewolf might be.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: I think Thomas and Emily bring up a valid point. We shouldn't rush to accuse anyone without concrete evidence. Instead, let's focus on gathering more information. Perhaps we can share our own experiences from last night or any unusual behavior we've noticed lately. This might help us uncover any inconsistencies or suspicious actions.",
        "Sophia: You're right, Thomas and Emily. It's important to gather as much information as possible before making any hasty decisions. Let's share our experiences from last night and any observations we've made about each other's behavior. This will give us a better chance at identifying any inconsistencies or suspicious actions.",
        "Victoria: \n\nVictoria: While it's important to gather more information, we also need to be proactive in our search for the Werewolf. Let's not be afraid to voice our suspicions or share any unusual behavior we've noticed. The more we communicate, the closer we are to finding the true culprit.",
        "Thomas: Indeed, Victoria. We must strike a balance between gathering information and taking decisive action. Let us not be afraid to voice our suspicions and discuss any unusual behavior we have noticed. By working together, we can navigate these treacherous waters and bring justice to Millers Hollow.",
        "Emily:  I agree with everyone's sentiments. We should continue sharing our suspicions and observations, but let's exercise caution and avoid making baseless accusations. We need concrete evidence to identify the true culprit. Let's work together to protect our village.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: I think it's important to strike a balance between gathering information and taking action. We shouldn't let fear paralyze us, but at the same time, we need to be careful about making baseless accusations. Let's be attentive to any inconsistencies or unusual behavior we notice, and if we have strong suspicions, we should voice them. It's essential that we work together to protect our village and root out the true culprit.",
        "Sophia: I completely agree with everyone's sentiments. It's crucial that we strike a balance between sharing suspicions and gathering concrete evidence. Let's stay vigilant and observe each other's actions closely. If we notice any inconsistencies or unusual behavior, we should voice our concerns. Together, we can protect our village and bring justice to Millers Hollow.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: \n\nBenjamin: I appreciate your concerns, but I believe we should not rush to conclusions without substantial evidence. Let's consider the facts carefully. Thomas and Emily, may I ask why you both voted for me? What specific behavior or evidence has led you to this decision?",
