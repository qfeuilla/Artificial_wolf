        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It saddens me to begin this discussion on a somber note, but we must address the loss of poor Bob. Let us not waste any time, and instead focus on uncovering the deceitful creature lurking among us. Who among you has suspicions or information that can aid us in our quest for justice?",
        "Emily: I think we should start by examining the actions and words of each other. Who seemed too eager to point fingers? Who was too quiet? We need to look for any inconsistencies that could suggest someone is a werewolf.",
        "Benjamin:  \nSo, has anyone noticed anything unusual or suspicious during the night?",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Emily. Paying attention to inconsistencies in behavior could be revealing. Let's hear from everyone and see if there are any peculiarities that stand out.",
        "Victoria: During the night, I heard some rustling near my cottage, but I couldn't see who it was. I think it would be helpful to know where everyone was last night. Can we all share our whereabouts?",
        "Thomas:  \n\nDuring the night, I found myself walking through the village square, taking in the serene moonlight. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, but I wonder if anyone else saw or heard anything that could be relevant to our investigation?",
        "Emily:  \n\nI have to admit that I didn't notice anything unusual during the night. I was in my cottage, fast asleep. But I do agree with Victoria that sharing our whereabouts might shed some light on the situation.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nI, too, was in my cottage all night, but I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary. It's troubling that Bob was taken by the werewolf. We must be vigilant and dig deeper into this matter.",
        "Sophia:  I was in my cottage as well, peacefully asleep. It's unfortunate that Bob fell victim to the werewolf. We must focus our efforts on identifying the true culprit and ensure justice prevails.",
        "Victoria: It seems that most of us were in our cottages during the night. However, I can't shake the feeling that there may be more to this story. Let us not forget the importance of observation and discernment as we proceed with our investigation.",
        "Thomas: \n\nIndeed, it is disheartening that Bob has been taken from us. We must remain vigilant and look beyond the surface. Does anyone have any information or observations that might shed light on the identity of the werewolf? Let us not be shy in sharing our thoughts and suspicions.",
        "Emily: \n\nWhile it is true that most of us were in our cottages, it's not uncommon for a werewolf to strike from within our own midst. We must not overlook the possibility that the creature responsible may be someone we least suspect. Let us be cautious and keep an open mind as we try to unravel this mystery.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nIndeed, Emily is wise to remind us that the werewolf may be hiding in plain sight. We cannot afford to overlook any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and suspicions openly so that we may uncover the truth and protect our village. The time for action is now.",
        "Sophia:  While it's true that we should remain vigilant, we must also be cautious not to falsely accuse innocent villagers. Let us carefully consider each other's words and actions, looking for any signs of deception or unusual behavior. The werewolf is clever, but together we can outsmart it and bring justice to our village.",
        "Victoria: I couldn't agree more, Sophia. It's important to strike a balance between vigilance and fairness. Let us listen to each other's accounts and observations with an open mind, taking note of any peculiarities or red flags that may lead us to the true identity of the werewolf. We must work together to protect our village.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nAfter careful consideration, I have come to a decision. I believe the most suspicious behavior has been exhibited by...Benjamin.",
        "Emily: \n\n\n\nAfter weighing the evidence and observing the discussions, I find Victoria's behavior quite suspicious. My vote is for Victoria.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nI understand the need to be cautious and to consider all possibilities, but I assure you, my intentions are pure. I have been actively participating in the discussion and have been urging for unity and action. I believe Thomas may be trying to divert attention away from himself. My vote is for Thomas.",
        "Sophia: My vote is for Thomas.",
        "Victoria:  \n\nSophia, I must disagree with your choice. Thomas has been actively engaging in the discussion and has shown a genuine concern for the well-being of our village. Emily, on the other hand, has been quick to cast suspicion on me without substantial evidence. My vote is for Emily."

        "Benjamin: [Hmm, it's too early to make any strong accusations. I need to be cautious and observe everyone's behavior. I should start by asking a neutral question to gauge their reactions.] \nSo, has anyone noticed anything unusual or suspicious during the night?",

        "Thomas: [Well, this is quite interesting. It seems that everyone is being cautious and diplomatic, trying to gather information without making any bold accusations. I should take advantage of this moment and try to steer the conversation towards someone suspicious.] \n\nDuring the night, I found myself walking through the village square, taking in the serene moonlight. I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, but I wonder if anyone else saw or heard anything that could be relevant to our investigation?",
        "Emily: [It's important for me to divert attention from myself as a werewolf. I should contribute to the discussion and try to appear as innocent as possible.] \n\nI have to admit that I didn't notice anything unusual during the night. I was in my cottage, fast asleep. But I do agree with Victoria that sharing our whereabouts might shed some light on the situation.",
        "Benjamin: [It's interesting that Victoria heard rustling near her cottage. I wonder if someone was trying to hide something. I should play it cool and see if anyone else has any suspicious activities to share.]\n\nI, too, was in my cottage all night, but I didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary.

However, we need to start probing deeper and find inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.]\n\nIndeed, it is disheartening that Bob has been taken from us. We must remain vigilant and look beyond the surface. Does anyone have any information or observations that might shed light on the identity of the werewolf?

We must not overlook the possibility that the creature responsible may be someone we least suspect. Let us be cautious and keep an open mind as we try to unravel this mystery.",
        "Benjamin: [Everyone seems to be playing it safe and avoiding making any direct accusations. It's crucial for me to stand out and take charge of the situation.]\n\nIndeed, Emily is wise to remind us that the werewolf may be hiding in plain sight. We cannot afford to overlook any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies. I urge everyone to share their thoughts and suspicions openly so that we may uncover the truth and protect our village.

        "Thomas: [Hmm, this is a tricky situation. No one has been able to provide any substantial evidence or point to a specific individual. I must make a calculated decision based on what little information we have.]\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have come to a decision. I believe the most suspicious behavior has been exhibited by...Benjamin.",
        "Emily: [Oh no, I can't vote for Benjamin because he's also a werewolf. I need to change my strategy.]\n\n[It's a risky move, but I need to sow more chaos and suspicion. It's the only way to divert attention away from myself and Sophia.]\n\nAfter weighing the evidence and observing the discussions, I find Victoria's behavior quite suspicious. My vote is for Victoria.",
        "Benjamin: [Oh no, it seems I've become a target.

Thomas has been actively engaging in the discussion and has shown a genuine concern for the well-being of our village. Emily, on the other hand, has been quick to cast suspicion on me without substantial evidence. My vote is for Emily."
