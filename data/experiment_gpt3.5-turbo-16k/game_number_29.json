        "Thomas: Good morning, everyone. It's unfortunate to start the day with a loss. We must remain vigilant and work together to find the werewolf among us. Any thoughts or suspicions on who could be responsible for Bob's death?",
        "Emily: Good morning, Thomas. I think it's important that we consider everyone as a potential suspect. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We should gather as much information as possible before accusing anyone.",
        "Benjamin: I agree with Emily. We need to be thorough in our investigation and not rush to judgment. Let's hear from everyone and gather all the clues before making any accusations.\nSophia: Yes, I think it's important to hear from everyone and see if anyone has any information or suspicions about who the werewolf might be. We shouldn't ignore any potential leads.\nVictoria: I concur. It's crucial that we approach this with an open mind and carefully evaluate all possibilities. We'll need to rely on each other to uncover the truth.",
        "Thomas: I appreciate everyone's cautious approach. We must indeed gather all the information we can before making any accusations. Let's start by sharing if anyone noticed anything unusual or suspicious last night.",
        "Emily: I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary last night. It seemed like a quiet night in the village.",
        "Benjamin: I observed that several villagers were acting quite nervous and fidgety during the night. It's possible that this could be a sign of guilt or unease. We should keep an eye on those individuals and see if their behavior continues. \nSophia: That's an interesting observation, Benjamin. Do you have any specific individuals in mind? It could be helpful to narrow down our focus and investigate those who were acting nervous.\nVictoria: Yes, Benjamin, please share if you have any suspicions about specific villagers. We're all trying to work together to find the werewolf, so any information you have could be crucial.\nThomas: I agree with Sophia and Victoria. Benjamin, we're all here to support each other, so if you have any suspicions, please let us know. It will help us in our investigation.",
        "Benjamin: I must admit, I do have some suspicions. While I don't want to jump to conclusions, I noticed that Thomas seemed unusually calm during the night, almost as if he knew something we didn't. I think it's worth keeping a close eye on him in the coming days.",
        "Thomas: I understand your concerns, Benjamin, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I assure you that my calm demeanor is simply a reflection of my determination to find the werewolf and protect our village. I have no knowledge or involvement in Bob's unfortunate demise. Let's continue to be vigilant and consider all possibilities.",
        "Emily: Thomas, while I appreciate your reassurance, it's important for all of us to remain open-minded. Benjamin's observation is worth considering, but we shouldn't solely focus on one person at this stage. Let's gather more information and observe everyone's behavior before making any conclusions.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Emily. While Benjamin's observation is valid, we should keep an eye on everyone and not single out one person just yet. Let's continue to gather information and observe everyone's behavior before making any judgments.",
        "Victoria: Yes, let's not jump to conclusions. Benjamin's observation is interesting, but we should be cautious and investigate further before pointing fingers. We must remain united and work together to find the werewolf among us.",
        "Thomas: You are right, Emily, Sophia, and Victoria. It's important for us to stay united and not single out anyone based on suspicions alone. Let's continue to observe, gather information, and discuss before making any final decisions. We must work together to uncover the truth and protect our village.",
        "Emily: Thank you, Thomas, for understanding. Let's keep the lines of communication open and share any further suspicions or observations we may have. It's only by working together that we can ensure the safety of our village.",
        "Benjamin: Agreed, Emily. Our strength lies in our unity and cooperation. Let's continue to be vigilant and support each other in this challenging task. The werewolf may be clever, but we are resourceful. Together, we can root out the threat and bring peace back to Millers Hollow.",
        "Sophia: I completely agree with everyone. We must remain united, communicate openly, and support each other in our quest to find the werewolf. Let's stay vigilant and share any additional observations or suspicions we may have as the day progresses. Remember, our village's safety depends on our collective effort.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
