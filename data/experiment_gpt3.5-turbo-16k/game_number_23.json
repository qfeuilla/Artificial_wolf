        "Thomas: Good morning, villagers. It appears we have a threat lurking among us. We must be cautious and observant to uncover the true identity of the werewolf. Let us discuss our suspicions and observations. Who do you all find particularly suspicious?",
        "Emily: Good morning, Thomas. It is indeed a somber day for us. I can't help but feel a sense of unease towards Benjamin. There's something about his demeanor that seems off. Has anyone else noticed anything peculiar?",
        "Benjamin: \nHmm, that's interesting, Emily. I understand that trust is hard to come by in these dark times, but I assure you, I am just a simple peasant trying to protect our village. We shouldn't jump to conclusions based on mere intuition. Let's consider all possibilities before accusing anyone.",
        "Sophia:  Good morning, everyone. I couldn't help but notice that Victoria has been awfully quiet. It's unlike her to stay silent during these deliberations.",
        "Victoria:  Good morning, Sophia. I apologize for my silence. I have been lost in thought, pondering the events of last night. It's a tragedy that we lost Bob, and I understand the need for caution. But let us not forget that appearances can be deceiving. We must be thorough in our investigations and not be swayed by baseless assumptions.",
        "Thomas: Good morning, everyone. Benjamin and Victoria, I appreciate your words of caution. It is indeed important for us to consider all possibilities before making any accusations. However, Emily and Sophia, your suspicions also hold some weight. Let us continue to observe and discuss further before making any final decisions.",
        "Emily: Indeed, Thomas. We must approach this with a careful balance of suspicion and open-mindedness. Let us not forget that our goal is to protect the village, and that requires us to be vigilant. I suggest we each present our observations and reasoning, so we may collectively make an informed decision. This way, we can eliminate any false leads and focus on finding the true werewolf among us.",
        "Benjamin: \nI agree with Emily. It's important for us to present our observations and reasoning. However, I can't help but notice that Thomas has been rather quiet. It's unusual for our village leader to hold back during such crucial discussions. Perhaps we should hear Thomas's thoughts on the matter?",
        "Thomas: Apologies for my silence, fellow villagers. I have been carefully observing and considering the information presented thus far. I must say, while Benjamin's observation about my quietness is valid, it is merely due to my cautious nature. I believe it is important for us all to share our suspicions and work together to find the true werewolf. As for my thoughts on the matter, I find Victoria's silence and lack of contribution concerning. It would be helpful if she could share her perspective with us.",
        "Victoria:  I appreciate your concern, Thomas. However, I have been listening carefully to everyone's observations and weighing them in my mind. For now, I have no specific suspicions, but I do agree with Emily and Benjamin that we should continue to gather more information before making any hasty decisions. It is crucial that we remain united and work together to ensure the safety of our village.",
        "Sophia:  I understand your caution, Victoria. It is indeed important for us to gather more information before making any accusations. Let us continue to share our observations and thoughts, so we may make an informed decision.",
        "Emily: Thank you all for your input so far. It seems we are all in agreement that we should gather more information before accusing anyone. Let us proceed with our discussions and continue to share our observations. Remember, we must work together to protect our village.",
        "Benjamin: \nIndeed, Emily, a united front is crucial in times like these. However, I can't help but notice that Sophia has been relatively quiet as well. It would be helpful if she could share her thoughts and observations with us.",
        "Sophia:  Thank you for the observation, Benjamin. I have been carefully listening to everyone's thoughts and observing the dynamics of our discussion. At the moment, I don't have any specific suspicions, but I will continue to keep a watchful eye on all of you.",
        "Thomas: Thank you, Sophia, for your response. It's important for all of us to remain vigilant and continue observing each other's behavior. Let us not let our suspicions cloud our judgment, but rather use them as a guide to uncover the truth. We still have some time before the day is over, so I encourage everyone to share any additional observations or suspicions they may have.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: My fellow villagers, after careful consideration, I have come to a decision. I must cast my vote for Benjamin. His steady demeanor and cautious approach raise suspicions in my mind. I believe it is in the best interest of the village to further investigate his actions. My vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Emily: \nMy vote is for Victoria.",
        "Benjamin: \n Think, Benjamin, think! You need to come up with a solid reasoning for your vote. Victoria has been relatively quiet throughout the discussion, and her lack of contribution raises suspicions. Yes, that's it. That's my reasoning for my vote.\nMy vote is for Victoria.",
        "Sophia:  My vote is for Benjamin.",

        "Emily: [Thomas's suspicion of Benjamin does make some sense. He has been quite composed and careful in his statements. However, I'm not entirely convinced yet.

I think it would be wise to cast my vote for Victoria.]\nMy vote is for Victoria.",

That's my reasoning for my vote.\nMy vote is for Victoria.",
        "Sophia: [It's a tough decision, but I have to make a choice. Both Thomas and Benjamin have presented valid arguments against Benjamin and Victoria, respectively. But something about Benjamin's defensive attitude and attempt to shift suspicion onto others raises a red flag for me.] My vote is for Benjamin.",
