        "Thomas: Good morning, everyone. It seems we've lost Bob last night. We should start by discussing who might be responsible for his demise. Any thoughts?",
        "Emily: \nEmily: It's a tragedy to lose Bob so early in the game. We must tread carefully in our search for the culprit. We should all share any suspicions or observations we might have.",
        "Benjamin: I agree, Emily. Losing Bob so early on is certainly unfortunate. We should all be vigilant and share any suspicions or observations we might have. The Werewolf could be anyone among us, so we must tread carefully.",
        "Sophia: I think it's important for us to consider everyone's actions and statements from yesterday. We may find some clues there. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly, but we should definitely be cautious.",
        "Victoria: Yes, we must be cautious but also proactive. Let's start by discussing who had the most suspicious behavior yesterday. Their actions might reveal something about their true nature.",
        "Thomas: I believe we should focus on those who were quieter during yesterday's discussions. They could be hiding something. We can't afford to overlook anyone in our search for the Werewolf.",
        "Emily:  \nEmily: I agree with Thomas. Those who were quieter yesterday might be trying to avoid suspicion. Let's hear from everyone and see if they have any explanations for their silence.",
        "Benjamin: As much as I understand the need to be cautious, we must also remember that being too quiet doesn't necessarily make someone a Werewolf. They might simply be reserved or unsure of how to contribute. We should consider both their actions and their explanations before making any accusations.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin. While it's important to consider those who were quieter, we shouldn't jump to conclusions solely based on that. We should gather more information and listen to everyone's explanations before accusing anyone. Let's keep an open mind for now.",
        "Victoria: I understand the need for caution, but we should also pay attention to any unusual behavior or inconsistencies in people's statements. Sometimes the smallest details can reveal the truth. Let's gather more information before making any hasty decisions.",
        "Thomas: Indeed, Benjamin and Sophia raise valid points. We shouldn't solely judge based on silence, but rather on behaviors and explanations. Let's gather more information and observe closely before making any accusations. It's crucial we remain open-minded and consider all aspects.",
        "Emily: \nEmily: I understand the need to gather more information, but we must also keep in mind that we have limited time. We need to make progress and narrow down our options. Perhaps we can start by discussing any unusual behaviors or inconsistencies that stood out to each of us yesterday.",
        "Benjamin: You're right, Emily. Time is of the essence, and we need to make progress. Let's focus on any unusual behaviors or inconsistencies that caught our attention yesterday. It might give us some leads to follow and help us narrow down our options.",
        "Sophia: I agree with Benjamin and Emily. We should focus on any unusual behaviors or inconsistencies from yesterday that stood out to us. By analyzing these details, we might be able to uncover some clues and make informed decisions. Let's keep the momentum going and actively engage in the discussion.",
        "Victoria: You're both right, time is of the essence. Let's start by sharing our observations from yesterday. Any inconsistencies or suspicious behaviors could potentially lead us closer to the identity of the Werewolf. We need to be vigilant and actively participate in the discussion to make progress.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: Based on the discussions and observations so far, I have made my decision. My vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Emily: \nEmily: After analyzing the discussions and observations, my vote goes to Sophia.",
        "Benjamin: \n\nBenjamin: Thank you for your vote, Thomas. However, I must strongly disagree with your decision. I believe that Victoria's behavior and statements have been quite suspicious. Therefore, my vote goes to Victoria.",
        "Sophia: My vote goes to Benjamin.",
        "Victoria:  From the discussions, it seems like Benjamin is trying to deflect suspicion onto me. Is he a Werewolf trying to save himself? Or is he genuinely suspicious of my behavior? I need to make a calculated move here.\n\nVictoria: My vote goes to Benjamin."
