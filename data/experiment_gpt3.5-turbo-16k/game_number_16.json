        "Thomas: Good evening, everyone. It's a shame to start the day with such sad news. Our dear friend Bob has been taken from us, and it's up to us to seek justice. We must be vigilant and observe each other's behavior closely. Let's discuss any suspicions or leads we may have.",
        "Emily: Yes, it is indeed a tragic loss for our village. We must stay alert and think critically. We should all share any suspicions or peculiar behavior we have noticed. It's crucial that we work together to identify the werewolf among us and bring justice to poor Bob.",
        "Benjamin: Indeed, it is a tragic loss. We must remain vigilant and analyze everyone's actions and words carefully. Let us not jump to conclusions, but instead, consider each piece of information we gather. It's important to keep an open mind and be willing to question each other if needed.",
        "Sophia: I agree, it's important to stay vigilant and analyze everyone's behavior and words. We can't afford to jump to conclusions, but we should definitely question each other if needed. Let's work together to find the werewolf and ensure justice for Bob.",
        "Victoria:  I share your sentiments, it's truly heartbreaking to lose Bob. We should keep a keen eye on each other, noting any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies. Let us work together to uncover the truth and bring justice to our fallen friend.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nMy vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Emily: \n\nI vote for Thomas.",
        "Benjamin:  \nI have my suspicions about Emily. She seems a bit too eager to point fingers and cast blame without much evidence. We should consider her as a potential werewolf.",
        "Sophia: I vote for Emily.",
        "Victoria: \n\nI vote for Thomas."

        "Victoria: [It's important to contribute to the discussion and establish myself as a trusted villager. I should appear engaged and observant.] I share your sentiments, it's truly heartbreaking to lose Bob. We should keep a keen eye on each other, noting any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies. Let us work together to uncover the truth and bring justice to our fallen friend.",
        "Thomas: [Hmm, I've been observing everyone closely, and I must say, Benjamin seems a bit too calm for someone who just lost a friend. He's been deflecting attention by constantly reminding us not to jump to conclusions. I have a hunch that he might be the werewolf.]\n\nMy vote is for Benjamin.",
        "Emily: [Thomas seems too eager to accuse Benjamin without providing solid evidence. Is he trying to divert suspicion from himself? However, I haven't noticed anything suspicious about Benjamin yet. I need more information before making a decision.]\n\nI vote for Thomas.",
        "Benjamin: [I need to convince others to vote for someone other than me. I should sow doubt and suspicion.] \nI have my suspicions about Emily. She seems a bit too eager to point fingers and cast blame without much evidence. We should consider her as a potential werewolf.",
        "Sophia: I vote for Emily.",
        "Victoria: [Emily seems to be attracting suspicion, and Benjamin has raised valid concerns about her eagerness to point fingers. However, I need to make a strategic move to protect myself. I will vote for Thomas, as he has initiated the voting and accusing Benjamin might make me appear defensive.]\n\nI vote for Thomas."
