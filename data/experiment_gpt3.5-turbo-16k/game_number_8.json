        "Thomas: Good evening, villagers. It saddens me to inform you that our dear friend Bob has been taken from us by the vile Werewolf. We must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the true identity of this creature. Let us begin our investigations and hear what each of you has to say.",
        "Emily: Yes, it is indeed a tragedy that we have lost Bob. We must be cautious and scrutinize each other's actions. Let's start by sharing any suspicions or observations we may have.",
        "Benjamin: I agree, we need to be cautious and observant. One thing I noticed is that Sophia was awfully quiet last night. It could be nothing, but it's worth considering.",
        "Sophia:  I share your grief for Bob's loss. We must remain united and investigate all possibilities. Perhaps the real werewolf is trying to frame me by making me look suspicious.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Sophia, let's not jump to conclusions too quickly. It's important to consider all possibilities and gather more information before accusing anyone.",
        "Thomas: I understand the need for caution, but we must also be proactive in our investigations. Benjamin's observation about Sophia's silence is worth noting, as the Werewolf may try to hide in plain sight. Let us hear more from Sophia and others to gather more information and make an informed decision.",
        "Emily: Indeed, it is wise to consider all possibilities. While Sophia's silence could be a cause for concern, we must also remember that the Werewolf may be trying to divert suspicion onto her. It is crucial that we gather more information before making any accusations. Let us hear from everyone and carefully analyze their actions and words.",
        "Benjamin:  \n\nI agree with Thomas. Let's gather more information and carefully analyze everyone's actions and words. It's important not to jump to conclusions too quickly, but we must also remain vigilant.",
        "Sophia:  I appreciate your caution, but let's not forget that Benjamin was quick to point out my silence. Could it be a diversion tactic? We should investigate him further to ensure we're not being misled.",
        "Victoria: I think it's important to consider all perspectives and not solely focus on one person. While Benjamin's observation about Sophia's silence is worth noting, we should also gather more information about other villagers. It's too early to single out anyone just yet.",
        "Thomas: Indeed, Victoria raises a valid point. While Benjamin's observation about Sophia is worth considering, we should not solely focus on one person. We must cast our net wider and gather more information about everyone's actions and behaviors. Let us continue the investigation and encourage open dialogue amongst ourselves.",
        "Emily: I agree with both Victoria and Thomas. While Benjamin's observation about Sophia is valid, we should not solely focus on one person. Let us cast a wider net and investigate everyone's actions and behaviors. It's important to encourage open dialogue and gather as much information as possible to make an informed decision.",
        "Benjamin:  \n\nI appreciate the caution, but let's not get sidetracked. It's important to investigate everyone and gather more information. We can't afford to overlook any potential leads.",
        "Sophia:  I agree with Benjamin. Let's not get sidetracked and overlook any potential leads. We should thoroughly investigate everyone's actions and behaviors to uncover the true identity of the Werewolf.",
        "Victoria: I concur with Benjamin and Sophia. It's crucial that we thoroughly investigate everyone's actions and behaviors without getting sidetracked. We must remain focused on uncovering the identity of the Werewolf and gather as much information as possible. Let us proceed with the investigation diligently.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

It's also worth noting that Thomas is pushing for more information, which could be a sign of a proactive villager or a clever werewolf trying to divert attention. I should be cautious and observe their behavior closely.] \n\nI agree with Thomas. Let's gather more information and carefully analyze everyone's actions and words.

        "Benjamin: [It seems like Sophia and Victoria are trying to divert attention away from themselves by questioning my motives. They're playing it safe, but I'm still suspicious of them. Thomas and Emily, on the other hand, seem genuinely interested in gathering more information. I'll keep observing everyone's actions and see if any patterns emerge.] \n\nI appreciate the caution, but let's not get sidetracked.

        "Thomas: [This is a critical moment. We must choose wisely and base our decision on solid reasoning. Benjamin's quickness to point out Sophia's silence raises suspicion, and it seems Sophia is also deflecting attention onto him. However, Victoria has remained cautious and level-headed throughout the discussion. While it's important to consider everyone, I feel compelled to vote for Benjamin as the potential Werewolf.]\n\nI vote for Benjamin.",
