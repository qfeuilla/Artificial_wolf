        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It deeply saddens me to inform you that our dear friend Bob has been taken from our midst by the treacherous claws of the Werewolf. We must act swiftly and decisively to protect our village. I urge each of you to share any suspicions or observations you may have. We cannot afford to be complacent in the face of this grave threat.",
        "Emily: Yes, it is indeed a tragic loss. We must remain vigilant and work together to root out the werewolf among us. Let us not waste any time and start sharing our suspicions and observations. Any information, no matter how small, could be crucial in our search for the culprit.",
        "Benjamin: I completely agree. This is a time for action, not hesitation. We must analyze every detail and listen carefully to each other's thoughts and suspicions. We cannot let fear divide us; only by working together can we unravel the mystery and protect our village. Let us begin the search for the Werewolf with determination and resolve.",
        "Sophia: Thomas, Emily, Benjamin, I appreciate your sentiments and your desire to protect the village. We must not let our emotions cloud our judgment. It is crucial that we approach this with a clear mind and a willingness to consider all possibilities. Let us examine each other's actions and statements carefully, for the Werewolf will surely attempt to hide among us.",
        "Victoria: Indeed, we must be diligent and thorough in our investigation. Let us not dismiss any suspicious behavior or unusual patterns. We should pay close attention to those who appear overly defensive or quick to accuse others. We must keep our eyes open and our minds sharp.",
        "Thomas: My fellow villagers, I must stress the importance of gathering evidence and sharing our suspicions openly. It is in our best interest to question each other and listen attentively. While it's difficult to trust anyone completely, we must rely on our instincts and the available information to make informed decisions. I implore each of you to participate actively in this search for the Werewolf, for our village's survival depends on it.",
        "Emily: I couldn't agree more, Thomas. We must remain vigilant and open-minded, even in the face of uncertainty. Let us not rush to judgment, but instead engage in thoughtful and respectful discussion. By pooling our knowledge and observations, we can find the truth and eliminate the threat that looms over our village.",
        "Benjamin: Indeed, Emily. Rushing to judgment without sufficient evidence will only lead to chaos and division among us. We must approach this investigation with patience and composure, carefully weighing the words and actions of our fellow villagers. Let us remember that the Werewolf will do whatever it takes to blend in, so we must be astute and attentive in our observations. Together, we can overcome this threat and restore peace to Millers Hollow.",
        "Sophia: Victoria, Thomas, Emily, and Benjamin, your words are wise and well-spoken. We must be cautious not to jump to conclusions, but also not to let the Werewolf slip through our fingers. Let us listen to one another's stories and watch for any inconsistencies or peculiar behaviors. Trust should be earned, not freely given. We must keep our wits about us and be ready to act swiftly when the time comes.",
        "Victoria: Thank you, Sophia, for your astute observations. We must be wary of those who try to manipulate our trust. Let us not forget that the Werewolf will stop at nothing to deceive us. We must scrutinize each other's motives and actions, seeking out any hints or clues that may lead us to the truth. Our village's survival depends on our ability to distinguish friend from foe.",
        "Thomas: Indeed, Victoria. In this game of uncertainty, we must be cautious of those who try to sway our judgment. Let us question each other, examine each other's motivations, and not shy away from confrontation if it brings us closer to identifying the Werewolf. We must be bold and unyielding in our pursuit of the truth, for the safety of our village hangs in the balance.",
        "Emily: I couldn't agree more, Thomas. We must be relentless in our search for the Werewolf, unafraid to confront one another if it means uncovering the truth. Let us be vigilant and observant, watching for any signs that may point to the identity of the culprit. Our village's survival rests on our shoulders, and we must not falter in our pursuit of justice.",
        "Benjamin: You speak the truth, Emily. We must not shy away from confrontation, for it is through scrutiny and questioning that we can uncover the true identity of the Werewolf. We must be fearless in our pursuit of justice, unafraid to challenge each other's words and actions. Let us be united in our vigilance and determination, for only then can we protect our village from this hidden threat.",
        "Sophia: Victoria, Thomas, Emily, Benjamin, your determination and vigilance inspire me. We cannot afford to be complacent or passive in the face of this danger. Let us be unrelenting in our pursuit of the truth, examining each other's every move and word for any trace of deception. We must be willing to confront and question one another, for it is through this process that we will discover the true identity of the Werewolf. Our village's survival depends on our unwavering resolve.",
        "Victoria: Thank you, Sophia, for your unwavering support. We must not back down in the face of this threat. Let us be relentless in our search for the Werewolf, scrutinizing each other's actions and words for any signs of deceit. We must confront the suspicions head-on and remain steadfast in our determination to protect our village. Together, we can prevail over this darkness.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
