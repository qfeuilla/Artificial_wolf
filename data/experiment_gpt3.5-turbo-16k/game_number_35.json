        "Thomas: Good evening, my fellow villagers. It is with heavy heart that I must commence this discussion. Our dear friend Bob has fallen victim to the Werewolf, and we must find the culprit. Let us not waste any time in our pursuit of justice. I propose we start by sharing our suspicions and any unusual behavior we may have noticed. Let us rally together and protect our village from this menace.",
        "Emily: What a tragedy! Poor Bob, may he rest in peace. We must remain vigilant and united in our quest to root out the Werewolf. I have been observing carefully, and I must say, Benjamin has been acting rather suspiciously. His sudden interest in the occult and frequent trips to the forest have raised my eyebrows.",
        "Benjamin: I understand your concern, Emily, but I assure you, my interest in the occult is purely for research purposes. As for my trips to the forest, I simply enjoy the tranquility and solitude it provides. I can understand why my behavior may seem suspicious, but I am just a curious soul seeking knowledge and peace. Let us not jump to conclusions without concrete evidence.",
        "Sophia:  It is indeed a tragedy that we have lost Bob, but we must not let emotions cloud our judgment. Let us consider all possibilities and gather more information before making any hasty accusations.",
        "Victoria: I agree with Sophia. While Benjamin's behavior is indeed peculiar, we cannot jump to conclusions without solid evidence. Let us observe and gather more information before pointing fingers.",
        "Thomas: I understand the need for caution, but we cannot afford to ignore any potential leads. Benjamin's behavior does raise some concerns, but we should also keep an eye on others. Let us all remain vigilant and observe each other closely. We must gather more evidence before making any final decisions.",
        "Emily: I understand the need for gathering more evidence, but we cannot dismiss our instincts entirely. Let's keep a watchful eye on Benjamin, but also be open to other possibilities. We must trust our intuition while being careful not to let it cloud our judgment.",
        "Benjamin: I agree with Emily. While it is important to remain cautious, we should also trust our instincts. Let us keep a watchful eye on each other and gather more evidence. We must work together to uncover the truth and protect our village from the Werewolf's grasp.",
        "Sophia:  Agreed. Let us keep our wits about us and continue to gather evidence. We must remain united in our pursuit of justice.",
        "Victoria: Indeed, unity is key in our pursuit of justice. Let us stay vigilant and observe each other's actions closely. We must work together to protect our village and uncover the truth. Trust is important, but so is gathering evidence. Let us proceed with caution and determination.",
        "Thomas: I appreciate everyone's input. Let us focus on gathering evidence, but also trust our instincts. We must work together as a united front to protect our village and find the Werewolf. The safety of Millers Hollow depends on our collective efforts.",
        "Emily: Yes, we must trust our instincts and stay united. Let us hold each other accountable and continue gathering evidence. We owe it to Bob and our village to bring the Werewolf to justice. Let our determination guide us in this quest for truth.",
        "Benjamin: Thank you for your understanding and support. I am committed to helping uncover the truth and protect our village. Let us continue to be vigilant and trust our instincts, for they may lead us to the true identity of the Werewolf. Together, we can prevail in this dark game and ensure the safety of Millers Hollow.",
        "Sophia:  I appreciate everyone's dedication to our village's safety. Let us remain watchful and continue to gather evidence. Remember, we are all in this together.",
        "Victoria: Let us not forget the gravity of our mission. The safety of Millers Hollow rests on our shoulders. We must trust our instincts, gather evidence, and work tirelessly to expose the Werewolf. Together, we can overcome this darkness and protect our beloved village.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",

I should keep an eye on him, but not accuse him just yet.] It is indeed a tragedy that we have lost Bob, but we must not let emotions cloud our judgment.
