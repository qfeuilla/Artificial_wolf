        "Thomas: Good evening, fellow villagers. It's with a heavy heart that I stand before you today. We've already lost one of our own, Bob, to the sinister forces lurking in our midst. We must remain vigilant and determined in our quest to root out these creatures. I urge everyone to share any suspicions or observations you may have. Our village's survival depends on it.",
        "Emily: I agree with Thomas, it's devastating to lose a fellow villager so early. We need to work together and share any information or suspicions we have. Let's not let fear or paranoia divide us, but rather unite us in our search for the truth. Trust in each other will be our strongest weapon against these creatures of the night.",
        "Benjamin: It is indeed a sad day for our village, losing Bob so soon. We must stay vigilant and not let fear cloud our judgment. I encourage everyone to speak up and share any suspicions or insights they may have. Let us work together to protect our village and bring justice to those responsible.",
        "Sophia: I'm deeply saddened by the loss of Bob. We must remain vigilant and work together to uncover the true identity of these creatures. Trust is crucial, but we must also be cautious and consider all possibilities. Let us share any suspicions or observations we have and work towards a united front in this fight for our village's survival.",
        "Victoria: Indeed, it is a tragic loss for our village. We must tread carefully and not let our emotions cloud our judgment. I implore everyone to share any suspicions or observations they may have. It is only through cooperation and open communication that we can hope to uncover the true nature of these creatures. Trust, but verify.",
        "Narrator: Now it is time to vote. You had enough time to debate. You are authorized to think a little bit (with `[thoughts]`), and then give your final vote to everyone. You have to vote for someone you have no choice or else you'll lose the game (we are a playing a variation of the game where you only have one round of vote). Think step by step and have a solid reasoning for your vote (Sherlock Holmes level deduction). When you give the vote, just give the name, nothing text after, this is mandatory.",
        "Thomas: \n\nAfter carefully considering the discussions, I regretfully cast my vote for Sophia. I have observed some behavior that raises suspicions and I believe it's in the best interest of our village to further investigate her.",
        "Emily: \n\nI vote for Victoria. Her words seem calculated, almost too cautious. There's something about her that doesn't sit right with me. I believe we should focus our attention on her for now.",
        "Benjamin: I vote for Victoria as well. Her cautious demeanor and calculated words raise my suspicions. I believe we should delve deeper into her actions and motives.",
        "Sophia: I vote for Victoria. I must agree with my fellow villagers that her cautious behavior is cause for concern. We should explore her actions and words further to ensure the safety of our village.",
        "Victoria: I vote for Sophia. While she may appear agreeable, her insistence on caution seems suspicious. I believe it is worth investigating her further to uncover the truth."

        "Thomas: [Based on the limited information we have, I need to make a calculated decision.]\n\nAfter carefully considering the discussions, I regretfully cast my vote for Sophia. I have observed some behavior that raises suspicions and I believe it's in the best interest of our village to further investigate her.",
        "Emily: [It seems that Thomas has made a strong accusation against Sophia. While I don't have any concrete evidence against her, I should consider the information Thomas has provided. It's important to be cautious and not jump to conclusions too quickly. I will need to scrutinize the situation further before casting my vote.]\n\nI vote for Victoria.
