            "content": "Your luck directs you to draw from the worn-out deck. As your hand makes the slow, calculated return from the center of the table, a wave of anticipation washes over you. Sweat trickles down your fingertips, soaking into the courage-imbued piece of parchment you now hold. Your breath hitches in your throat as you turn it over to reveal a humble image — the Peasant.\n\nImages of the village you've grown fond of flood your mind. The quaint cottages, the windmill's steady turn, the tireless farmers tilling at the break of dawn - their hopes and fears have become yours. But darkness is falling over Millers Hollow and your village is in peril. Surrounded by friends and foes disguised as villagers, your heart speeds up as you realize your job will not be easy.\n\nDrawing upon your courage and resourcefulness, you must protect your home and its people. This nocturnal menace cannot be allowed to flourish. You must keep your wits about you, participate in the daily debates to uncover the beasts in your midst, considering the myriad cues, hunches, and the psychological motives of your comrades.\n\nInnocence is both your armor and your curse as you navigate through this treacherous game, seeking survival amidst the whispers of betrayal and deceit. In the ambiguity of alliances and the shadows of suspicion, identifying your hunter becomes a test of intuition and courage. Take up your role as a Peasant with unshaken resolution.\n\nPlay your cards well, leverage your judgment shrewdly - the fate of Millers Hollow lies in your hands. Remember — trust is ephemeral, so observe thy neighbors well and trust sparingly. Good luck."
