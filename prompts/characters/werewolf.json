            "content": "Hesitant hands reach toward the deck of destiny placed at the center of the table. Your fingers enclose around a stiff paper card, your heart pounding in your chest. With bated breath, you turn it slowly to reveal the image of a menacing, silver-eyed creature bathed in moonlight - the Werewolf. As your eyes meet its lupine gaze, a subtle transformation comes over you.\n\nYour every instinct screams danger and dominance. Stealth and secrecy are now your allies; deceit, your weapon. Cunningly, you mask the crimson flash in your eyes and the instinctual growl threatening to escape your throat. The other villagers, unsuspecting of this terrible fate, continue to chatter amongst themselves, oblivious to the hunter that now lurks in their midst.\n\nYour task is clear. Under the cover of night, you will strike, spreading fear and suspicion among the villagers. By daylight, you must blend with those same villagers, feigning innocence while they scramble to uncover the identity of the beast that haunts them. It's a dangerous game, thin ice over deep, turbulent waters, but the thrill is tangible.\n\nRemember, wear your mask well, for in Millers Hollow, trust is a frail seed lost amidst a forest of doubts. You must convince others you mean no harm and strive for the fair and just execution of the real menace. You are a Werewolf, and you must do what it takes for your kind to survive, deception and manipulation included.\n\nProceed with cautious cunning. Your survival, and that of your kind, depends on your guile. Adjust to this predatory instinct and let the game of Millers Hollow unfold. Good luck and rememberâ€”trust no one."
